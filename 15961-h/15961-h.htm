<h2>TURNS OF FORTUNE</h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p>"Hush, Sarah!" exclaimed old Jacob Bond,
as he sat up in his bed, while the wind clattered
and whistled through the shivering window
frames. "Hush! Is that Brindle's bark?"</p>

<p>"No, father; it is one of the farm dogs near
the village. Lie down, dearest father; it is a
cold night, and you are trembling."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should feel cold, Sarah,"
he replied, pointing his shadowy fingers
towards the grate, where an abundant fire
blazed; "I am sure you have put down as much wood as would roast an ox."</p>

<p>"It is so very cold, father."</p>

<p>"Still, we must not be wasteful, Sarah," he
answered; "wilful waste makes woful want."
Sarah Bond covered the old man carefully
over, while he laid himself stiffly down upon his
pallet, re-muttering his favourite proverb over and over again.</p>

<p>She then drew the curtains more closely,
and seated herself in an old-fashioned chair
beside a little table in front of the fire.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>

<p>The room had been the drawing-room of the
old house in which Mr. Bond and his daughter
resided, but for the sake of saving both labour
and expense, he had had his bed removed into
it; and though anything but comfortable, a solitary,
impoverished, and yet gorgeous appearance
pervaded the whole, such as those who
delineate interiors, loving small lights and deep
shadows, would covet to convey to their canvass. The bed upon which the old man lay
was canopied, and of heavy crimson damask.
In the dim light of that spacious room, it looked
to the worn-out eyes of Sarah Bond more
like a hearse than a bed. Near it was an old
spinnet, upon which stood a labelled vial, a tea-cup,
and a spoon. When Sarah seated herself
at the table, she placed her elbows upon it,
and pressed her folded hands across her eyes;
no sigh or moan escaped her, but her chest
heaved convulsively; and when she removed
her hands, she drew a Bible toward her, trimmed the lamp, and began to read.</p>

<p>The voice of an old French clock echoed
painfully through the chamber. Sarah longed
to stop it, and yet it was a companion in her
watchings. Once, a shy, suspicious, bright-eyed
mouse rattled among the cinders, and ran
into the wainscot, and then came out again,
and stared at Sarah Bond, who, accustomed
to such visits, did not raise her eyes to inquire
into the cause of the rustling which in a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
more moments took place upon a tray containing
the remnants of some bread and cheese, her frugal supper.</p>

<p>"Sarah," croaked Mr. Bond; "what noise is that?"</p>

<p>"Only the mice, father, as usual; do, father,
try to sleep. I watch carefully; there is nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, men and mice all the same; nothing
but waste. When I am gone, Sarah, keep
what you will have; it won't be much, Sarah,
my poor girl, it won't be much; just enough to
need care; but KEEP IT; don't lend it, or give
it, or spend it; you are fond of spending, my
poor girl; see that huge fire, enough for three
nights; early bad habits. When we lived in a
small house and were poor, it was then you
learned to be extravagant; I had no money then, so did not know its value."</p>

<p>"But we were happier then, father," said
Sarah Bond; "we were so cheerful and happy
then, and so many poor people blessed my dear mother, and Mary"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hiss&mdash;ss," uttered the dying miser; "don't
dare mention your sister, who disgraced me by
marrying a pauper; a pauper who threatened
my life, because I would not give him my money
to save him from starving; but he <i>did not</i> get
the old father-in-law's gold; no; he <i>starved, and</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>The words thus uttered by her father, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
she knew had not many hours to live&mdash;uttered,
too, with such demoniac bitterness&mdash;forced the
gentle, patient woman to start from her seal,
and pass rapidly across the room to the side of
his bed, where she sank upon her knees, and
seized his shrunken hands in hers. "Father!"
she exclaimed, "I have been your child for forty
years, and you have said, that during that period,
by no act of my own, have I <i>ever</i> angered
you. Is it not so?" The old man withdrew
one hand gently, turned himself round, and
looked in her face: "Forty years! Is it forty
years?" he repeated; "but it must be; the fair
brow is wrinkled, and the abundant hair grown
thin and gray. You were a pretty baby, Sarah,
and a merry child; a cheerful girl, too, until
that foolish fancy. Well, dear, I'll say no more
about it; good, dutiful girl. You gave it up to
please your father full twenty years ago, and
when he dies, you shall have <i>all</i> his gold&mdash;there's
a good father! You must <i>keep</i> it, Sarah, and
not give it, nor lend it. I know you won't
marry, as <i>he</i> is dead; nor see your sister&mdash;mind
that; if you see <i>her</i>, or serve her, the bitterest
curse that ever rose from a father's grave will compass you in on every side."</p>

<p>"My father!" she said, "oh! in mercy to
yourself, revoke these words. She knew nothing
of her husband's conduct; he used her even
worse than he used you. Oh! for my sake
say you will forgive Mary. It is all I ask. Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
what you please with your wealth, but forgive my sister."</p>

<p>"You were always a fool, Sarah," he replied
faintly and peevishly. "If I could do as I
please, I would take my property with me, for
you will surely spend it. But there is another
condition, another promise you must give me.
Now, don't interrupt me again. We will talk
of <i>her</i> by-and-bye, perhaps. As long as you
live, Sarah, <i>as you value my blessing</i>, you
must not part with anything in this room. You
will live on in the old house, or perhaps sell it,
and have a smaller; yet don't spend money in
new furnishing&mdash;don't; but never part with
anything in <i>this room</i>; never so much as a stick."</p>

<p>This promise was willingly given; for, independently
of her love for her father, Sarah Bond
had become attached to the inanimate objects
which had so long been before her. Again she
endeavoured to lead her father away from that
avarice which had corrupted his soul, and driven
happiness and peace from their dwelling. She
urged the duty of forgiveness, and pleaded hard
for her sister; but, though the hours wore away,
she made no impression upon him. Utterly
unmindful of her words, he did not either interrupt
her or fall into his former violence. On
the contrary, he seemed involved in some intricate
calculation&mdash;counting on his fingers, or
casting up lines of imaginary figures upon the coverlit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

<p>Sarah, heart-broken, and silently weeping,
retreated to the table, and again, after turning
the fire, betook her to her solace&mdash;the precious
volume that never fails to afford consolation to
the afflicted. She read a few passages, and
then, though she looked upon the book, her
mind wandered. She recalled the happy days
of her childhood, before her father, by the extraordinary
and most unexpected bequest of a
distant relative, became possessed of property
to what extent she could form no idea. She
knew that this relative had quarrelled with the
heir-at-law, and left all to one he had never seen.
This bequest had closed up her father's heart;
instead of being a blessing, so perfectly avaricious
had he grown, that it was a curse. Previously,
he had been an industrious farmer; and
though a thrifty one, had evinced none of the
bitterness of avarice, none of its hardness or
tyranny. He could then sleep at nights, permit
his wife and children to share their frugal stores
with those who needed, troll "Ere around the
huge oak," while his wife accompanied him on
the spinnet, and encourage his daughters to wed
men in what was their then sphere of life, rather
than those who might not consider the gentle
blood they inherited, and their superior education,
a sufficient set-off to their limited means
and humble station. Suddenly, riches poured
in upon him: his eldest daughter, true to the
faith she plighted, would marry her humble
lover, and her father's subsequent harshness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
her favourite child broke the mother's heart.
Sarah not only had less firmness of character
than her sister, but loved her father more devotedly,
and gave up the affection of her young
heart to please him. His narrow nature could
not understand the sacrifice: and when her
cheek faded, and her really beautiful face contracted
into the painful expression of that pining
melancholy which has neither words nor tears&mdash;to
lull his sympathy, he muttered to himself,
"good girl, <i>she</i> shall have <i>all</i> I have."</p>

<p>No human passion grows with so steady, so
imperceptible, yet so rampant a growth as avarice.
It takes as many shapes as Proteus, and
may be called, above all others, the vice of middle
life, that soddens into the gangrene of old
age; gaining strength by vanquishing all virtues
and generous emotions, it is a creeping, sly,
keen, persevering, insidious sin, assuming various
forms, to cheat even itself; for it shames
to name itself unto itself; a cowardly, darkness-loving
sin, never daring to look human
nature in the face; full of lean excuses for self-imposed
starvation, only revelling in the impurity
and duskiness of its own shut-up heart. At
last the joy-bells ring its knell, while it crawls
into eternity like a vile reptile, leaving a slimy track upon the world.</p>

<p>The inmates of the mansion enclosed in its
old court-yard had long ceased to attract the
observation of their neighbours. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
Sarah called at the butcher's, but she exchanged
smiles or greetings with few; and the baker
rang the rusty bell twice a-week, which was answered
by their only servant. When Mr. Bond
first took possession of the manor-house, he
hired five domestics, and everybody said they
could not do with so few; and there were two
men to look after the gardens; but after his
daughter's elopement and his wife's death, three
were discharged, and he let the lands and gardens;
and then another went, and Sarah felt
the loneliness so great, that she made the remaining
one sleep in her own room. The house had
been frequently attacked; once, in a fit of despair,
her brother-in-law had forced his way in
the night to the old man's side, and but for her
prompt interference, murder would have been
done. No wonder, then, that her shattered
nerves trembled as she watched the shortening
candle, and heard the raving of the wind, saw
the spectral shadows the broken plumes that
ornamented the canopy of the bed cast upon
the fantastic walls, <i>felt</i> that <i>his</i> hour was at
hand, and feared that "he would die and make
no sign;" still, while those waving fantasies
passing to and fro through her active but weakened
mind, made her tremble in every limb,
and ooze at every pore; and though unable to
read on steadily, her eyes continued fixed upon
the book which her hand grasped, with the same
feeling that made those of old cling to the altar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
of their God for sanctuary. Suddenly her father
called&mdash;and she started as from a dream&mdash;"Sarah!"</p>

<p>She hastened to his side; "Dear father, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Child, the room is dark; and you had so
much light just now. All is dark. Where are
you? But it was better, after all, to put out the light; wilful waste makes"&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the miser had concluded his proverb,
the light of <i>his</i> existence was extinguished for ever!</p>




<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p>Several weeks elapsed before Sarah Bond
recovered sufficiently from the shock, ay, and
genuine grief, occasioned by her father's death,
so as to investigate her affairs; the hardness
and the tyranny she had borne for so many
years had become habitual, and her own will
was absolutely paralysed by inaction. Jacob
Bond had always treated his daughter as if she
were a baby, and it was some time before she
could collect herself sufficiently to calculate upon
her future plans. She had no friends; and the
sister to whom, despite her father's cruel words,
her heart clung so fondly, was far from her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
she knew not where. The mourning for herself
and her servant was ordered from a neighbouring
shop, with a carelessness as to expense
which made people say that Sarah was of habits different from her father.</p>

<p>The rector and curate of the parish both
called, but she shrunk from strangers. The
very first act, however, of her liberty, was to
take a pew at church, a whole pew, to herself,
which she ordered to be curtained all round.
Some said this indicated pride, some said ostentation; but it was simply shyness. And
soon after she placed in the aisle a white marble
tablet, "To the memory of Jacob Bond,
who died in the seventy-eighth year of his age,
deeply lamented by his sorrowing daughter."</p>

<p>Some ladies connected with a society for
clothing the poor, called upon and explained
to her their object; she poked five old guineas
into the hands of the spokeswoman, but forbade
the insertion of her donation in the visitor's
book. During the following week she had
numerous applications from various charitable
bodies, to whom she gave generously, they
said, while she reproached herself with narrowness;
to all, however, she positively refused to
become a yearly subscriber; and when closely
urged by the rector to be one of the patrons of
his school, she answered, "Sir, my father received
his property suddenly, and I may be as
suddenly deprived of it. I will give, but I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
not promise." Her impulse was to give, her habit to withhold.</p>

<p>She added one more servant to her establishment;
and as she did not send out cards returning
thanks for the 'inquiries,' which increased
daily, Sarah Bond was a very lonely
woman; for though some, from curiosity, others
from want of occupation, others, again, from
the unfortunately universal desire to form acquaintance
with the rich, would have been glad,
now the solitary old miser was gone, to make
fellowship with his gentle-looking and wealthy
daughter, yet her reserve and quietness prevented
the fulfilment of their wishes. Weeks and
months rolled on; the old house had been repaired and beautified. Mr. Cramp, Sarah's
law agent and 'man of business,' advised her
to let the house, of which she occupied about as
much as a wren could fill of the nest of an eagle;
and, strangely enough, finding that the house of
her childhood was to let, she took it, removing
thither all the furniture which her father made
her promise never to part with. The ceiling of
the best bed-room was obliged to be raised to
admit the lofty bed with its plumes, and the spinnet
was assigned a very comfortable corner in
a parlour, where the faded stately chairs and
gorgeous furniture formed a curious contrast to
the bright neatly-papered walls and drugget-covered
floor; for in all matters connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
her own personal expenses, Sarah Bond was exceedingly frugal.</p>

<p><i>After</i> her removal, though shy and strange as
ever, still she <i>looked</i> kind things to her rich, and
<i>did</i> kind things to her poor neighbours, only in
a strange, unusual way; and her charity was
given by fits mid starts&mdash;not continuously. She
moved silently about her garden, and evinced
much care for her plants and flowers. Closely
economical from long habit, rather than inclination, her domestic arrangements were
strangely at variance with what could not be
called public gifts, because she used every effort
in her power to conceal her munificence. She
did not, it is true, think and calculate, how the
greatest good could be accomplished. She
knew but one path to charity, and that was
paved with gold. She did not know how to
offer sympathy, or to enhance a gift by the
manner of giving. Her father had sacrificed
everything to multiply and keep his wealth;
all earthly happiness had been given up for it;
and unsatisfying as it had been to her own
heart, it had satisfied his. Inclination prompted
to give, habit to withhold; and certainly
Sarah Bond felt far more enjoyment in obeying
inclination than in following habit; though
sometimes what she believed a duty triumphed over inclination.</p>

<p>If Sarah Bond ministered to her sister's necessities,
she did so secretly, hardly venturing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
to confess she did so, but shielding herself from
her father's curse, by sending to her sister's
child, and not her sister. Receiving few letters,
the village postman grumbled far more at having
to walk out to Greenfield, than if he was
accustomed to do so every day; and one morning
in particular; when he was obliged to do so
while the rain poured, he exhibited a letter,
sealed with a large black seal, to the parish-clerk,
saying he wished with all his heart Miss
Bond had remained at the old manor-house up
street, instead of changing; and where was
the good of taking her a mourning letter such
a gloomy day? it would be very unkind, and
he would keep it "till the rain stopped;" and
so he did, until the next morning; then taking
back word to the village postmaster that Miss
Bond wanted a post-chaise and four horses instantly,
which intelligence set not only the inn,
but the whole village in commotion. She, who
had never wanted a post-chaise before, to want
four horses to it now, was really wonderful.</p>

<p>"Which road shall I take, Miss?" inquired
the post-boy, turning round in his saddle, and touching his cap.</p>

<p>"On straight," was the answer. Such a
thrill of disappointment as ran through the
little crowd, who stood at the door to witness
her departure. "On straight!" Why, they
must wait the post-boy's return before they
could possibly know which way she went. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
provoking suspense was enough to drive the entire village demented.</p>

<p>Miss Bond remained away a month, and then
returned, bringing with her her niece, a girl of
about eight years old&mdash;her deceased sister's only child, Mabel Graham.</p>

<p>The following Sunday Sarah Bond went to
church, leading her young companion by the
hand; both were in deep mourning, and yet
the very least observant of the congregation
remarked, that they had never seen Miss Bond
look so happy as when, coming out after service,
and finding that the wind had changed to
the north-east, she took off her scarf in the
church porch, and put it round the neck of the
lovely girl, who strongly remonstrated against
the act. It was evident that Mabel had been
accustomed to have her own way; for when
she found her aunt was resolved her throat
should be protected, she turned round, and in
a moment tore the silk into halves. "Now,
dear aunt, neither of our throats will suffer,"
she exclaimed; while Sarah Bond did not
know whether she ought to combat her wilfulness
or applaud the tender care of herself. It
was soon talked of throughout the village, how
wonderfully Sarah Bond was changed; how
cheerful and even gay she had become. Instead
of avoiding society, how willingly, yet
how awkwardly, she entered into it; how
eagerly she sought to learn and to make herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
acquainted with every source and system
of education. No traveller in the parchy desert
ever thirsted more for water than she did for
knowledge, and her desire seemed to increase
with what it fed upon. The more she had the
more she required; and all this was for the
sake of imparting all she learned to Mabel.
She fancied that teachers might not be kind to
this new-found idol; that she could transfer information
more gently and continuously; that
the relative was the best instructress; in short,
the pent-up tenderness of her nature, the restrained
torrent of affections that had so long
lain dormant, were poured forth upon the little
heiress, as she was already called; and captious
and determined she was, as ever heiress could
be; but withal of so loving a nature, and so
guileless a heart, so confiding, so generous, and
so playful, and overflowing with mirth and mischief,
that it would have been impossible to
fancy any living creature who had felt the sunshine
of fourteen summers more charming or tormenting.</p>

<p>"I wish, dear aunt," exclaimed Mabel, one
morning, as she sat at her embroidery, the sun
shining through the open window upon the
abundant glories of her hair, while her aunt sat,
as she always did, opposite to her, that she
might, when she raised her eyes from off the
Italian lesson she was conning for her especial
edification, have the happiness of seeing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
without an effort; "I wish, dear aunt, you
would send that old spinnet out of the room;
it looks so odd by the side of my beautiful piano."</p>

<p>"My dear Mabel," replied her aunt, "I have
put as much <i>new</i> furniture as you wished into
this room, but I cannot part with the old"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" added Mabel, snapping her
worsted with the impatience of the movement.</p>

<p>"It may be rubbish in <i>your</i> eyes, Mabel, but
I have told you before that my dear father desired
I should never part with the furniture of the room he died in."</p>

<p>Mabel <i>looked</i> the truth&mdash;"that she was not
more inclined toward the old furniture on that
account;" but she did not say so. "Have you
got the key of the old spinnet, aunt? I should like to hear its tone."</p>

<p>"I have never found the key, my dear,
though I have often looked for it; I suppose my
father lost it. I have danced to its music before
now to my mother's playing; but I am sure it has not a tone left."</p>

<p>"I wish you would dance now, dear aunt,"
exclaimed Mabel, jumping up at the idea; "you
never told me you could dance; I never, somehow,
fancied you could dance, and I have been
obliged to practise my quadrilles with two high-backed
chairs and my embroidery frame. Do,
dear aunt; put by that book, and dance." It
would be impossible to fancy a greater contrast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
than aunt and niece. Sarah Bond's erect and
perfectly flat figure was surmounted by a long
head and face, round which an abundance of
gray hair was folded; for by no other term can
I describe its peculiar dress; her cap plain, but
white as snow; and a black silk gown, that had
seen its best days, was pinned and <i>primmed</i> on,
so as to sit as close as possible to a figure which
would have been greatly improved by heavy and
abundant drapery. Mabel, lithe and restless,
buoyant and energetic, unable even to wish for
more luxury or more happiness than she possessed,
so that her active mind was <i>forced</i> to
employ its longings on trifles, as it really had
nothing else to desire; her face was round as
those faces are which become oval in time; and
her bright laughing eyes sparkled like sunbeams
at the bare notion of making "aunt Sarah"
take either the place of a high-backed chair, or
the embroidery frame in a quadrille. "Do dance," she repeated.</p>

<p>"My dear child, I know as little of your
quadrilles as you do of my country dances and
reels. No, Mabel; I can neither open the
spinnet nor dance quadrilles; so you have been
twice refused this morning; a novelty, is it not, my dearest Mabel?"</p>

<p>"But why do you not break open the spinnet?
Do break it open, aunt; I want to see the inside of it so much."</p>

<p>"No, Mabel; the lock is a peculiar one, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
could not be broken without defacing the marquetre
on the cover, which I should not like to
do. My poor mother was so proud of that
cover, and used to dust and polish it with her own hands."</p>

<p>"What! herself?" exclaimed the pretty Mabel; "why did not her servants do it?"</p>

<p>"Because, my dear, she had but one."</p>

<p>"But one! I remember when my poor
mamma had none," sighed Mabel, "and we were <i>so</i> miserable."</p>

<p>"But not from lack of attendants, I think,"
answered Sarah Bond. "If they <i>are</i> comforts,
they are careful ones, and sadly wasteful. We
were never so happy as we were then. Your
mother and I used to set the milk, and mind the
poultry, and make the butter, and cultivate the
flower-garden, and help to do the house work;
and then in the evening we would run in the
meadows, come home laden with wild flowers,
and tired as we were by alternate work and
play, my dear mother would play on that old
instrument, and my poor father sing, and we
sisters wound up the evening by a merry dance,
your mother and myself trying hard which could keep up the dance longest."</p>

<p>Mabel resumed her embroidery without once
speaking. Sarah Bond laid down the book she
had been reading, and moved restlessly about;
her manner, when either thoughtful or excited,
prevented her features from being disturbed; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
her feelings were soothed by wandering from
place to place, or table to table; but after a considerable
pause, she said&mdash;"I wish you were a
little older, Mabel; I wish you to be older, that
I might convince you, dear, that it is in vain to
expect happiness from the possession of wealth,
unless we circulate it, share it with others, and
yet do so prudently and watchingly. Yet, my
poor dear father would be very angry if he heard me say that, Mabel."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," interrupted the thoughtless girl, "<i>for he was a miser</i>."</p>

<p>"Hush, Mabel!" exclaimed her aunt; "how
can you say anything so harsh of him from
whom we inherit all we have. He was careful,
peculiar, very peculiar; but he saved all for
me; and may God judge mercifully between
him and me if I cannot in all things do as he
would have had me," and then she paused, as
if reasoning and arguing with herself; apologising
for the human throes in her own bosom
that led her to act so frequently in direct opposition
to her father's desires; so that to those
who could not understand her motives and feelings,
she appeared every day more inconsistent.
"It is difficult to judge of motives in any case.
I am sure, if he had only gone abroad into the
world, and seen distress as I have seen it, he
could not have shut his heart against his fellow-creatures:
but his feelings were hardened
against some, whom he considered types of all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
and he shut himself up; and seeing no misery,
at last believed, as many do, whom the world
never dreams of calling as you called him, Mabel&mdash;seeing
no misery, believed that it only existed
in the popular whine. I am sure, if he
had seen, he would have relieved it. I always
think <i>that</i> when I am giving; it is a great
blessing to be able to give; and I would give
more, were I not fearful that it might injure you."</p>

<p>"Injure me, dear aunt, how?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mabel, my heart is greatly fixed upon
seeing you a rich heiress, and, in time, suitably established."</p>

<p>"You have just been saying how much happier
you were when you were all poor together, and yet you want to make me rich."</p>

<p>"People may be very happy in poverty before
they have known riches; but having once
been rich, it would, I think, be absurd to suppose
we could ever be happy again in poverty."</p>

<p>"I saw," replied the girl, "two children pass
the gate this morning while I was gathering
flowers&mdash;bunches of the simple white jessamine
you love so much, dear aunt&mdash;and they asked
so hard for bread, that I sent them a shilling."</p>

<p>"Too much," interrupted Sarah Bond, habitually
rather than from feeling; "too much,
dear Mabel, to give to common beggars."</p>

<p>"There were two, you know, and they looked
wan and hungry. About three hours after,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
I was cantering my pony down Swanbrook
Lane&mdash;the grass there is so soft and green, that
you cannot hear his feet, while I can hear
every grasshopper that chirps&mdash;suddenly, I
heard a child's voice singing a tune full of
mirth, and I went softly, softly on; and there,
under a tree, sat one of my morning acquaintances,
making believe to sing through a stick,
while the other danced with bare feet, and her
very rags fluttered in time to the tune. They
looked pale and hungry, though a thick crust of
bread upon the grass proved that they were not
the latter; but I never saw more joy in well-fed,
well-clothed children, for they paused and
laughed, and then began again. Poverty was
no pain to <i>them</i>, at all events."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Sarah Bond, "you forget
the crust of bread was their riches, for it was a superfluity."</p>

<p>"And is it not very shocking that in England
a crust of bread <i>should be</i> a superfluity," inquired Mabel.</p>

<p>"Very, dear; <i>but a shilling was a great deal
to give at the gate</i>," observed her aunt, adding,
after a pause, "and yet it shows how little will
make the poor happy. I am sure, if my father
had looked abroad, instead of staying at home
to watch his&mdash;his&mdash;money, he would have
thought it right to share what he had. It is an
unnatural thing to shut one's self up from the
duties of life; one gets no interest for any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
outlay to do the heart service; but though
those poor children danced their rags in the
sunshine, and felt not the stones they danced
on, yet my dear Mabel could not dance with
poverty as her companion&mdash;my blessed, blessed child!"</p>

<p>"I'd rather dance a jig with mirth than a
minuet with melancholy," laughed the girl;
"and yet it would take a great deal to make
me miserable if I were with you, and you loved
me, my dear aunt. Still, I own I like to be
rich, so as to have everything I want, and give
everybody what they want; and, aunt Sarah,
you know very well I cannot finish this rose
without the pale floss silk, and my maid forgot
both that and to order the seed pearl."</p>

<p>Mabel's complaint was interrupted by the
entrance of the servant, who told Miss Bond
that Mr. Cramp, her attorney, wished to see her.</p>

<p>"Show him in," said Miss Bond.</p>

<p>"He wishes to see you alone, ma'am."</p>

<p>"His wife is going to die, and he will want
you to marry him!" exclaimed Mabel, heedless
of the servant's presence. "Do, dear aunt, and let me be bride's-maid."</p>

<p>Sarah Bond changed colour; and then,
while stooping to kiss her wayward niece, she called her "a foolish child."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>




<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p>Mr. Cramp, whom we introduced at the conclusion
of the last chapter, as Miss Bond's man
of business, was a plain little man, skilled in
the turnings and windings of the law, beside
which he could not be said to know distinctly any other code of morals.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, after a few common-place observations, Mr. Cramp made a
somewhat strange inquiry. "Had Miss Bond
heard that Mr. Alfred Bond had come over to
England?" No; she had not heard it. It
was, Mr. Cramp <i>insinuated</i> (for he never <i>said</i>
anything directly)&mdash;it was rather an awkward
circumstance Mr. Alfred Bond's coming to
England. He thought&mdash;he believed&mdash;he <i>hoped</i>
it would make no difference to Miss Bond.</p>

<p>Miss Bond opened her wide eyes still more
widely. She knew that Mr. Alfred Bond was
the heir-at-law to the property bequeathed her
father; but what of that? he had never, that
she heard of, dreamed of disputing the will;
and she had never felt one pang of insecurity
as to the possessions which had of late grown
so deeply into her heart. At this unexpected
intimation she felt the blood rush through her
veins in a wild untameable manner. In all her
trials&mdash;and they had been many&mdash;in all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
illnesses&mdash;not a few&mdash;she had never fainted, never
fallen into that symptom of weak-mindedness,
a fit of hysterics; but now she sat without power
of speech, looking at Mr. Cramp's round face.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Bond, you are not ill, I hope?"
exclaimed Mr. Cramp. "I pray you to bear up;
what has been said is doubtless wrong&mdash;must
be wrong; a threat of the opposite party&mdash;an
undefined threat, which we must prepare ourselves
to meet in a lawyer-like way. Hope for the best, and prepare"&mdash;</p>

<p>"For what, sir?" inquired Miss Bond, gaspingly.</p>

<p>"For any&mdash;anything&mdash;that is my plan. Unfortunately,
the only way to deal with the world,
so as to meet it on equal terms, is to think every
man a rogue. It is a deeply painful view to
take of human nature, and it agonizes me to
do so. Let me, however, entreat you to bear up"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Against what, sir?" said Sarah Bond abruptly,
and almost fiercely, for now Mr. Cramp's
face was reduced to its original size, and she
had collected her ideas. "There are few things
I could <i>not</i> bear up against, but I must know what I have to sustain."</p>

<p>"Your father's will, my dear lady, is safe;
the document, leaving everything to you, that
is safe, and all other documents are safe enough
except Cornelius Bond Hobart's will&mdash;a will
bequeathing the property to your uncle. <i>Where</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
is that will to be found? for if Alfred Bond proceeds,
the veritable document must be produced."</p>

<p>"Why, so it can be, I suppose," said Sarah
Bond, relapsing in some degree into agitation;
"it was produced when my father inherited the property, as you know."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Bond," he answered;
"certainly not as I <i>know</i>, for I had not the
honour of being your father's legal adviser at
that time. It was my master and subsequent
partner. I had not the privilege of your father's
confidence until after my colleague's death."</p>

<p>"No one," said Miss Bond, "ever had my
father's <i>confidence</i>, properly so called; he was
very close in all money transactions. The will,
however, must be, I think, in Doctors' Commons! Go there immediately, Mr. Cramp;
and&mdash;stay&mdash;I will go with you; there it is, and
there are the names of the witnesses."</p>

<p>"My dear lady!" expostulated the attorney,
in the softest tones of his soft voice, "I <i>have</i>
been there already. I wished to spare a lady
of your sensibility as much pain as possible;
and so I went there myself, with Mr. Alfred
Bond's man of business, whom I happened to
know; and I was grieved&mdash;cut up, I may say,
to the very heart's core, to hear what he said;
and he examined the document very closely too&mdash;very
closely; and, I assure you, spoke in
the handsomest, I may say, the <i>very</i> handsomest
manner of you, of your character, and usefulness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
and generosity, and Christian qualities;
he did indeed; but we have all our duties to
perform in this world; paramount things are
duties, Miss Bond, and his is a very painful one."</p>

<p>"What need of all these words to state a
simple matter. Have you seen the will?" said Sarah Bond.</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Well, and what more is there to see, unless
Mr. Alfred Bond denies his relative's power to make a will?"</p>

<p>"Which, I believe he does not do. He says
he never made a will; that is all."</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> the will," maintained Sarah Bond.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to wound you; but cannot you understand?"</p>

<p>"Speak plainly if you can, sir," said Sarah
Bond sternly; "speak plainly if you can; I listen."</p>

<p>"He maintains, on the part of his client, that the will is a forgery."</p>

<p>"He maintains a falsehood, then," exclaimed
Miss Bond, with a firm determination and dignity
of manner that astonished Mr. Cramp.
"If the will be forged, who is the forger? Certainly
not my father; for he inherited the property
from his elder brother, who died insane.
The will is in <i>his</i> favour, and not in my father's.
Besides, neither of them held any correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
with the testator for twenty years; he
died abroad, and the will was sent to England
after his death. Would any one there do a
gratuitous service to persons they had never
seen? Where could be the reason&mdash;the motive?
How is it, that, till now, Alfred Bond urged no
claim. There are reasons," she continued,
"reasons to give the world. But I have within
me, what passes all reason&mdash;a feeling, a conviction,
a true positive knowledge, that my father
was incapable of being a party to such a crime.
He was a stern man, loving money&mdash;I grant
that&mdash;but honest in heart and soul. The only
creature he ever wronged was himself. He did
<i>that</i>, I know. He despoiled himself of peace
and comfort, of rest and repose. In <i>that</i> he
sinned against God's dispensation, who gives
that we may give, not merely to others, but lawfully
to ourselves. After all, it would have
been but a small thing for him to have been
without this property, for it gave him no one
additional luxury. I wonder, Mr. Cramp, that
you, as a man, have courage to stand before me,
a poor unprotected woman, and dare to say, that will is forged."</p>

<p>While she spoke, Sarah Bond stood forth a
new creature in the astonished eyes of the sleek
attorney. He absolutely quailed before the vehemence
and fervour of the usually mild woman.
He assured her she was mistaken; that <i>he</i> had
not yielded to the point that the will was a forgery;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
that he never would confess that such
was the case; that it should be his business to
disprove the charge; that he hoped she did not
suppose he yielded to the plaintiff, who was resolved
to bring the matter into a court of justice.
He would only ask her one little question;
had she ever seen her father counterfeit different
hands? Yes, she said, she had; he could
counterfeit, copy, any hand he ever saw, so that
the real writer could not tell the counterfeit from
the original. Mr. Cramp made no direct observation
on this, except to beg that she would
not mention that "melancholy circumstance" to any one else.</p>

<p>Sarah Bond told him she should not feel
bound to make this talent of her father's a crime,
by twisting into a <i>secret</i> what he used to do as
an amusement. Mr. Cramp urged mildly the
folly of this, when she had a defence to make;
but she stood all the more firmly upon what she
fearlessly considered the dignity of right and
truth; at the same time assuring him, she would
to the last contest that <i>right</i>, not so much for
her own sake, or the sake of one who was dear
to her beyond all power of expression, but for
the sake of <i>him</i> in whose place she stood, and
whose honour she would preserve with her life.
Mr. Cramp was a good, shrewd man of business.
He considered all Miss Bond's energy, on the
subject of her father's honour, as romance,
though he could not help believing <i>she</i> was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
earnest about it. He thought it was perfectly
in accordance with the old miser's character,
that he should procure or make such a document;
though he considered it very extraordinary,
for many reasons, that it should have imposed
upon men more penetrating and learned than himself.</p>

<p>Sarah Bond, after his departure, endeavoured
to conceal her anxiety from her niece; but in
vain. Mabel was too clear-sighted; and it was
a relief, as much as an astonishment to her
aunt, to see how bravely she bore up against
the evil news. Miss Bond did not remember
that the knowledge of the <i>power</i> of wealth does
not belong to sixteen summers. Mabel knew
and thought so little of its artificial influence,
that she believed her happiness sprang from
birds and flowers, from music, and dancing,
and books&mdash;those silent but immortal tongues
that live through centuries, for our advantage;
besides, her young heart welled forth so much
hope, that she really did not understand, even
if they lost their fortune, their "troublesome
fortune," as she called it, that it would seriously
affect their happiness. There was no philosophy,
no heroism in this; it was simply the impulse
of a bright, sunny, beautiful young mind.</p>

<p>The course of events promised soon to strip
Mabel of all except her own bright conceptions.
Mr. Alfred Bond urged on his plea with all the
energy and bitterness of one who had been for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
many years despoiled of his right. His solicitor,
soon after his claim was first declared, made an
offer to Sarah Bond to settle an annuity on her
and her niece during the term of their natural
lives; but this was indignantly spurned by
Sarah; from him she would accept no favour;
she either had or had not a right to the whole
of the property originally left to her uncle. Various
circumstances, too tedious to enumerate,
combined to prove that the will deposited in
Doctors Commons was not a true document;
the signature of Cornelius Bond Hobart was
disproved by many; but second only to one incident
in strangeness was the fact, that though
sought in every direction, and widely advertised
for in the newspapers of the day, the witnesses
to the disputed document could not be found&mdash;they had vanished.</p>

<p>The incident, so strange as to make more
than one lawyer believe for a time that really
such a quality as honesty was to be found in
the world, was as follows:&mdash;Sarah Bond, be it
remembered, had never seen the disputed will;
she was very anxious to do so; and yet, afterwards,
she did not like to visit Doctors Commons
with any one. She feared, she knew not
what; and yet, above all things, did she desire
to see this will with her own eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Cramp was sitting in his office when a
woman, muffled in a cloak, and veiled, entered
and seated herself without speaking. After a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
moment she unclasped her cloak, loosened the
wrapping from her throat, threw back her veil, and asked for a glass of water.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Miss Bond, is it you? I am sure I am much honoured&mdash;very much!"</p>

<p>"No honour, sir," she replied, "but necessity.
I have been to Doctors Commons; have
seen the will&mdash;it is my father's writing!"</p>

<p>"You confess this to me?" said Mr. Cramp,
drawing back on his chair, and almost gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"I do," she answered; "I proclaim it; it is
my father's <i>copy</i> of the original will. But how
the copy could have been substituted for the real will, I can only conjecture."</p>

<p>"Surmise is something," replied the lawyer,
a little relieved; "conjecture sometimes leads to proof."</p>

<p>"My father and uncle lived together when
the will came into their possession. They were
in partnership as farmers. My father's habits
were precise: he always copied every writing,
and endorsed his copies with a large <i>C</i>; the
very <i>C</i> is marked upon the will I have just seen at Doctors Commons."</p>

<p>"That is singular," remarked Cramp; "but
it does not show us the way out of the difficulty;
on the contrary, that increases. <i>Somebody</i>&mdash;I
don't for an instant suppose Mr. Jacob
Bond&mdash;in proving the will must have sworn
that, to the best of their knowledge and belief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
those were the real, which are only copies of the signatures."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;and such a mistake was extremely
characteristic of my uncle, who performed
many strange acts before he was known to be
insane. This was doubtless one of them."</p>

<p>"But <i>where</i> is the original?" inquired the man of business.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows! I cannot find it; but I am
not the less assured of its existence."</p>

<p>"Then we must persist in our plea of the
truth of the document in Doctors Commons."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Sarah; "you must
not persist in a falsehood in my name. If you
do, I shall rise up in court, and contradict you!
I feel it my duty, having seen the will, to state
my firm belief that it is a copy of the original will, and nothing more."</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Cramp was dreadfully annoyed.
He could, he thought, manage all sorts of clients.
He reasoned, he proved, he entreated,
he got her counsel to call upon her, but all was
in vain. She would go into court, she said,
herself, if her counsel deserted her. She would
<i>not</i> give up the cause; she would plead for the
sake of her father's honour. She was well assured
that the real will was still in existence,
and would be discovered&mdash;found&mdash;sooner or
later&mdash;though not, perhaps, till she was in her grave.</p>

<p>The senior counsel was so provoked at what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
he called his client's obstinacy, that he threw up
his brief, and the junior took advantage of the
circumstance to make a most eloquent speech,
enlarging upon the singularity of no appeal
having been previously made by the plaintiff&mdash;of
the extraordinary disappearance of the witnesses&mdash;of
the straight-forward, simple, and
beautiful truthfulness of the defendant; in short,
he moved the court to tears, and laid the foundation
of his future fortune. But after that
day, Sarah Bond and her niece, Mabel, were
homeless and houseless. Yet I should not say
that; for the gates of a jail gaped widely for
the "miser's daughter," but only for a few
days; after which society rang with praises,
loud and repeated, of Mr. Alfred Bond's liberality,
who had discharged the defendant's costs
as well as his own. In truth, people talked so
much and so loudly about this, that they altogether
forgot to inquire what had become of Sarah and Mabel.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<p>The clergyman of the parish was their first
visiter. He assisted them to look into the future.
It was, he who conveyed to Sarah Bond
Alfred's determination that she should be held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
scatheless. The good man delivered this information with the manner of a person who
feels he comes with good news, and expects it
will be so received; but Sarah Bond could only
regard Alfred as the calumniator of her father's
memory, the despoiler of her rights. The wild
expression of joy in Mabel's face, as she threw
herself on her aunt's bosom, gave her to understand
that she ought to be thankful for what saved her from a prison.</p>

<p>Words struggled for utterance. She who
had borne so much and so bravely, was overcome.
Again and again she tried to speak,
but for some hours she fell from one fainting
fit into another. She had borne up against all
disasters, until the power of endurance was
overwhelmed; and now, she was attacked by
an illness so violent, that it threatened dissolution.
At this very time, when she needed so
much sympathy, a stern and severe man, in
whom there was no pity, a man who had received large sums of money from Miss Bond
as a tradesman, and whose account had stood
over from a particular request of his own, believing
that all was gone, and that he should
lose, took advantage of her illness to levy an
execution upon the goods, and to demand a sale.</p>

<p>At this time her reason had quite deserted
her, and poor Mabel was incapable of thought
beyond her duty to her aunt, which made her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
remove her to a cottage-lodging from the turmoil
of the town. No one distinctly knew, except
Mabel, why Sarah Bond was so attached
to the old furniture, and few cared. And yet
more than one kind heart remembered how she
had liked the "rubbishing things," and bought
in several, resolved that, if she recovered, and
ever had "a place of her own again," they
would offer them for her acceptance. Her illness
was so tedious, that except the humble curate
and the good rector, her inquirers had fallen
off&mdash;for long sickness wears out friends.
Some would pause as they passed the cottage
window, where the closely-pinned down curtain
told of the caution and quiet of sickness; and
then they would wonder how poor Miss Bond
was; and if they entered the little passage to
inquire, they could scarcely recognise in the
plainly-dressed, jaded, bent girl, whose eyes
knew no change but from weeping to watching,
and watching to weeping, the buoyant and beautiful
heiress whose words were law, and who
once revelled in luxury. The produce of the
sale&mdash;though everything, of course, went below
its value&mdash;left a small surplus, after all debts
and expenses were paid; which the clergyman
husbanded judiciously, and gave in small portions
to Mabel. Alfred Bond himself called to
offer any assistance that might be required,
which Mabel declined, coldly and at once.</p>

<p>Patiently and devotedly did she watch beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
the couch of her poor aunt; one day suffering
the most acute anxiety if the symptoms became
worse than usual; the next full of hope as they
abated. Did I say that one day after another
this was the case? I should have written it,
one hour after another; for truly, at times she
fluctuated so considerably, that no one less
hopeful than Mabel could have continued faithful
to hope. As Sarah Bond gained strength,
she began to question her as to the past. Mabel
spoke cautiously; but, unused to any species
of dissimulation, could not conceal the
fact, that the old furniture, so valued by her
uncle, and bequeathed with a conditional blessing,
was gone&mdash;sold! This had a most unhappy
effect on the mind of Sarah Bond. She felt
as if her father's curse was upon her. She
dared not trust herself to speak upon the subject.
When the good rector (Mr. Goulding)
alluded to the sale, and attempted to enter into
particulars, or give an account of the affairs he
had so kindly and so ably managed, she adjured
him in so solemn a manner never to speak
of the past, if he wished her to retain her reason,
that he, unconscious of the motive, and
believing it arose entirely from regret at her
changed fortunes, avoided it as much as she
could desire; and thus she had no opportunity
of knowing how much had been saved by the
benevolence of a few kind persons. Sarah
Bond fell into the very common error of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
imagining that persons ought to <i>know</i> her thoughts
and feelings, without her explaining them. But
her mind and judgment had been so enfeebled
by illness and mental suffering, that, even while
she opposed her opinions, she absolutely leaned
on Mabel&mdash;as if the oak called to the woodbine
to support its branches. What gave Mabel
the most uneasiness, was the determination
she had formed to leave the cottage as soon as
she was able to be removed; and she was seriously
displeased because Mabel mentioned this
intention to Mr. Goulding. Despite all poor
Mabel could urge to the contrary, they quitted
the neighbourhood&mdash;the sphere of Sarah Bond's
sudden elevation, and as sudden depression&mdash;alone,
at night, and on foot. It was a clear,
moonlight evening, in midsummer, when the
twilight can hardly be said to give place to
darkness; and when the moon shines out so
very brightly, that the stars are reduced to pale
lone sparks of <i>white</i> rather than <i>light</i>, in the
blue sky. It was a lovely evening; the widow
with whom they had lodged was not aware of
their intention until about an hour before their
departure. She was very poor and ignorant,
but her nature was kind; and when Sarah Bond
pressed upon her, out of her own scanty store,
a little present of money beyond her stipulated
rent, she would not take it, but accompanied
them to the little gate with many tears, receiving
charge of a farewell letter to the rector. "And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
haven't you one to leave me for the curate?"
she inquired. "Deary me! but I'm sure for
every once the old gentleman came when Miss
Bond was so bad, the curate came three times;
and no letter for him! deary, oh, deary me!"</p>

<p>"Why did you not put me in mind to write
to Mr. Lycight, Mabel?" inquired her aunt,
after the gate, upon which the poor woman leaned, had closed.</p>

<p>Mabel made no reply; but Sarah felt the
hand she held tightly within hers tremble and
throb. How did she then remember the days
of her own youth, as she thought, "Oh! in
mercy <i>she</i> might have escaped from what only
so causes the pulses to beat or the hand to
tremble!" Neither spoke; but Sarah had
turned over the great page of Mabel's heart,
while Mabel did not confess, even to herself,
that Mr. Lycight's words, however slight, were
more deeply cherished than Mr. Goulding's precepts. They had a long walk to take that
night, and both wept at first; but however sad and
oppressed the mind and spirits maybe, there is a
soothing and balmy influence in nature that
lulls, if it does not dispel, sorrow; every breeze
was perfumed. As they passed the hedges,
there was a rustling and murmuring of birds
amongst the leaves; and Mabel could not forbear
an exclamation of delight when she saw a
narrow river, now half-shadowed, then bright
in the moonbeams, bounding in one place like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
a thing of life, then brawling around sundry
large stones that impeded its progress, again
subsiding into silence, and flowing onward to
where a little foot-bridge, over which they had
to pass, arched its course; beyond this was the
church, and there Mabel knew they were to
await the coach which was to convey them to a
village many miles from their old homes, and
where Sarah Bond had accidentally heard there
was a chance of establishing a little school.
Mabel paused for a moment to look at the venerable
church standing by the highway, the
clergyman's house crouching in the grove behind.
The hooting and wheeling of the old
owls in the ivied tower was a link of life. Sarah
Bond passed the turn-stile that led into the
church-yard, followed by Mabel, who shuddered
when she found herself surrounded by damp
grass-green graves, and beneath the shadows of old yew-trees.</p>

<p>She knew not where her aunt was going, but
followed her silently. Sarah Bond led the way
to a lowly grave, marked by a simple head-stone.
She knelt down by its side, and while
her bosom throbbed, she prayed earnestly,
deeply, within her very soul&mdash;she prayed, now
a faded, aged woman&mdash;she prayed above the
ashes, the crumbling bones of him she had loved
with a love that never changes&mdash;that is green
when the head is gray&mdash;that Mabel might never
suffer as she had suffered. Relieved by these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
devotional exercises, Sarah rose, and the humble
and stricken pair bade adieu to the melancholy
scene, and betook themselves to their toilsome
journey. Fortunately the stage soon
overtook them, and having, with some difficulty,
obtained seats, they were in due time deposited
in a village, where Sarah felt there would
be no eyes prying into their poverty, no ears to
hear of it, no tongue to tell thereof, and point
them out "as the poor ladies that once were
rich." This was a great relief, though it came
of pride, and she knew it; and she said within
herself, When health strengthens my body, I
will wrestle with this feeling, for it is unchristian.
She never even to Mabel alluded to
what was heaviest on her mind&mdash;the loss of the
old furniture; though she cheered her niece by
the assurance that, after a few months, if the
Almighty blessed the exertions they must make
for their own support, she would write to their
friend Mr. Goulding, and say where they were;
by "that time," she said, she hoped to be humble,
as a Christian should be. After this assurance
was given, it was astonishing to see how
Mabel revived. Her steps recovered their elasticity,
her eyes their brightness. Sarah Bond
had always great superiority in needlework, and
this procured her employment; while Mabel
obtained at once, by her grace and correct
speaking, two or three day pupils. Her wild
and wayward temper had been subdued by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
change of circumstances; but if she had not
found occupation it would have become morose
Here was not only occupation, but success;
success achieved by the most legitimate means&mdash;the
exertion of her own faculties; there were
occasionally bitter tears and many disappointments;
and the young soft fingers, so slender
and beautiful, were obliged to work in earnest;
and she was forced by necessity to rise early
and watch late; and then she had to think, not
how pounds could be spent, but pennies could
be earned. We need not, however, particularize
their labours in this scene of tranquil usefulness.
It is sufficient to say that Mabel's little
school increased; and both she and her aunt
came at length to feel and speak thankfully of
the uses of adversity, and bless God for taking as well as for giving.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<p>Though Sarah Bond had used every means
within her power to conceal her place of retreat,
yet she often felt bitterly pained that no one had
sought her out. She said she wished to be forgotten,
unless she had the power to clear away
the imputation on her father's name. And yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
unknown to herself, she cherished the hope,
that some one would have traced them, though
only to say one cheering word of approbation
regarding their attempt at self-dependence.
Sarah thanked the Almighty greatly for one
thing, that Mabel's cheerfulness was continued
and unfluctuating, and that her mind seemed
to have gathered strength by wholesome exercise.
She believed her affections, if not free,
were not entangled, and that her pride had risen
against her imagination; and it was beautiful
to see how, watching to avoid giving each other
pain, striving continually to show the bright side
of every question, the one to the other, and extract
sweets instead of bitters from every little
incident, led to their actually enjoying even the
privations which exercised their tenderness towards each other.</p>

<p>Time wore away many of their sorrows, which
old father Time always does; a kindness we
forget to acknowledge, though we often arraign
him for spoiling our pleasures. Sarah and Mabel
had been taking an evening walk, wondering
how little they existed upon, and feeling
that it was a wide step towards independence to have few wants.</p>

<p>"I can see good working in all things," said
Mabel; "for if I had obtained the companionship
of books, which I so eagerly desired at first,
I should not have had the same inducement to
pursue my active duties, to read my own heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
and the great book of nature, which is opened
alike to peer and peasant; I have found so much
to learn, so much to think of by studying objects
and persons&mdash;reading persons instead of books."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Sarah Bond; "and seeing how
much there is to admire in every development
of nature, and how much of God there is in every human being."</p>

<p>As they passed along the village street, Mabel
observed that the cottagers looked after them,
and several of her little pupils darted their heads
in and out of their homes, and laughed; she
thought that some village fun was afloat, that
some rural present of flowers, or butter, or
eggs, had been sent&mdash;a little mysterious offering
for her to guess at; and when she turned to
fasten the wicket gate, there were several of the
peasants knotted together talking. A sudden exclamation
from her aunt, who had entered the
cottage, confirmed her suspicion; but it was
soon dissipated. In their absence, their old
friends Mr. Goulding and the curate had arrived
by the coach, and entered their humble dwelling. From a wagon at the same time were
lifted several articles of old furniture, which
were taken into the cottage, and properly arranged.
There were two old chairs, an embroidered
stool, a china vase, a cabinet, a table,
and the spinnet. Strangely the furniture looked
on the sanded floor, but never was the spiciest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
present from India more grateful to its receiver
than these were to the eyes of Sarah Bond.
She felt as if a ban was removed from her when
she looked upon the old things so valued by her
father. Absorbed in the feelings of the moment,
she did not even turn to inquire how they had
so unexpectedly come there. Nor did she note
the cold and constrained greeting which Mabel
gave to Mr. Lycight. She herself, after the first
self-engrossed thoughts were past, turned to
give both gentlemen the cordial reception which
their many former kindnesses, not to speak of
their apparent connexion with the present gratifying
occurrence, deserved. From Mr. Goulding
she learnt that the furniture had been
bought up by a few old friends, and committed
to him to be sent to her as a mark of their goodwill;
he had only delayed bringing it to her,
till she should have proved, as he knew she
would, superior to her misfortunes, by entering upon some industrious career.</p>

<p>As the evening closed in, and the astonishment
and feelings of their first meeting subsided,
Sarah Bond and Mr. Goulding conversed
apart, and then, indeed, she listened with a
brimming heart and brimming eyes. He told
of his young friend's deep attachment to Mabel;
how he had prevailed upon him to pause
before he declared it; to observe how she endured
her changed fortune; and to avoid engaging
her affections until he had a prospect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
placing her beyond the reach of the most harrowing
of all poverties, that which keeps up an
appearance above its means. "Her cheerfulness,
her industry, her goodness, have all been
noted," he continued. "She has proved herself
capable of accommodating herself to her
circumstances; the most difficult of all things
to a young girl enervated by luxury and indulgence.
And if my friend can establish an interest
in her affections, he has no higher views of
earthly happiness, and I think he ought to have
no other. You will, I am sure, forgive me for
having counselled the trial. If deep adversity
had followed your exertions&mdash;if you had failed
instead of succeeded&mdash;I should have been at hand to succour and to aid."</p>

<p>Sarah Bond had never forgotten the emotion
of Mabel, caused by the mention of the curate's
name when they quitted their old neighbourhood,
and the very reserve Mabel showed proved to
Sarah's searching and clear judgment, that the
feeling was unchanged. Truly in that hour
was her chastened heart joyful and grateful.
"Mabel must wait," she said, "until the prospect
of advancement became a reality; for it
would be an ill return of disinterested love
for a penniless orphan to become a burden instead
of a blessing. Mabel would grow more
worthy every day; they were doing well; ay,
he might look round the white-washed walls and
smile, but they <i>were</i> prosperous, healthful, happy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
and respected; and if she could only live to
see the odium cast upon her father's memory
removed, she would not exchange her present
poverty for her past pride." She frequently
afterwards thought of the clergyman's rejoinder&mdash;"That
riches, like mercy, were as blessed to
the giver as to the receiver, and that they only
created evil when hoarded, or bestowed by a heedless hand."</p>

<p>They certainly were a happy group in that
lowly cottage room that evening. Mabel's
proud bearing had given place, as if by magic,
to a blushing shyness; which she tried to shield
from observation by every possible attempt at
ease. She talked to Mr. Goulding, and found
a thousand uses for the old furniture she had
once so heartily despised. "She would sit in
the great high chair at the end of that table,
with her feet on the stool, and the china vase in
the midst, filled with humble cottage flowers&mdash;meadow-sweet
and wild roses, and sweet-williams,
sea-pinks, woodbine, and wild convolvulus!
Did Mr. Goulding like cottage flowers
best?" No; the clergyman said he did not,
but he thought Mr. Lycight did, and the young
man assured her that it was so; and then gazed
on the only love his heart, his deep, unworn,
earnest heart, had throbbed to, with an admiration
which is always accompanied by fear, lest
something should prevent the realization of the one great earthly hope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
And Mabel was more fitful than her aunt had
ever seen her. Fearful lest her secret, as she
thought it, should be discovered, she made as
many turns and windings as a hare; and yet,
unskilled in disguising her feelings, after spending
many words in arranging and re-arranging,
she suddenly wished that the spinnet could be
opened, "If," she exclaimed, "<i>that</i> could be
opened, I should be able to teach Mary Godwin
music; and her mother seemed to wish it so
much: surely we can open the instrument?"</p>

<p>"It has not been opened for years," replied
Miss Bond; "and I remember, once before,
Mabel wished it opened, and I refused, lest
forcing the lock might harm the marquetre, of
which my poor mother was so fond. It has
never been opened since her death." But Mabel's
desire was of too much consequence, in
her lover's eyes, to be passed over, although all
seemed agreed that if it were opened it could
not be played upon; so in a few minutes he
procured a smith, who said he would remove
the hinges, and then unscrew the lock from the
inside, which would not injure the cover. This
was done; but greatly to poor Mabel's dismay,
the cavity, where strings once had been, was filled with old papers.</p>

<p>"Now, is not this provoking?" said Mabel,
flinging out first one and then another bundle
of letters. "Is not this provoking?"</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Sarah Bond, grasping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
a lean, long, parchment, round which an abundance of tape was wound. "No. Who knows
what may be found here?" At once the idea
was caught, Mabel thought no more of the
strings. "I cannot," said Sarah Bond to Mr.
Goulding, "untie this; can you?" Her fingers
trembled, and she sank on her knees by the
clergyman's side. The eyes of the little group
were fixed upon him; not a word was spoken;
every breath was hushed; slowly he unfastened
knot after knot; at last the parchment was unfolded;
still, neither Sarah Bond nor Mabel
spoke; the latter gasped for breath&mdash;her lips
apart, her cheeks flushed; while Sarah's hands
were clasped together, locked upon her bosom,
and every vestige of colour had deserted her face.</p>

<p>"Be calm, my dear friend," he said, after
glancing his eyes over the parchment; "be
calm. You have experienced enough of the
changes and chances of this world not to build
too quickly upon any foundation but the one&mdash;the
goodness of God; I do believe this is an
especial proof of His Providence, for I do think
this is Cornelius Bond Hobart's original will in your uncle's favour."</p>

<p>It would be useless to attempt a description
of the scene that followed; but the joy at the
<i>reality</i> of the discovery was a heartful temperate
joy&mdash;the joy of chastened hearts. Sarah
Bond, blessing God, above all things, that, go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
the law as it would, her father's memory would
now be held as the memory of an honest man;
that he had, as she had said, copied, not forged
the will. Mr. Goulding declared he should find
it difficult to forgive himself for having so long
prevented the old furniture from being sent, assuring
her, the dread that Mabel was unfit to
contend with the privations to which the lives
of humble men are doomed, made him tremble
for the happiness of the young friend who had
been consigned to his care by a dying mother;
he feared to renew the intercourse, until her
character was developed; while poor Mabel
had little thought how closely she was watched
along the humble and thorny paths she had to traverse.</p>

<p>Sarah Bond's spirit was so chastened, that
she regretted nothing save the shadow cast upon
her father's grave; and now that was removed,
she was indeed happy. She assured the rector
how useful adversity had been to them&mdash;how
healthful it had rendered Mabel's mind&mdash;and
how much better, if they recovered what had
been lost, they should know how to employ
their means of usefulness. Mr. Lycight's congratulations
were not so hearty as Mr. Goulding's;
he felt that <i>now</i> he was the curate and
Mabel the heiress; and he heard the kind good
night which Mabel spoke with a tingling ear.
<i>He</i>, was proud in his own way; and pride, as
well as his affection, had been gratified by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
idea of elevating her he loved. Mabel saw this,
and she wept during the sleepless night, that he
should believe her so unworthy and so ungrateful.</p>

<p>There was much to think of and to do; the
witnesses were to be found, and lawyers consulted,
and proceedings taken, and much of the
turmoil and bitterness of the law to be endured,
which it pains every honest heart to think upon;
and Mr. Cramp was seized with a sudden fit of
virtuous indignation against Mr. Alfred Bond,
after Sarah Bond's new "man of business" had
succeeded in producing the only one of the witnesses
in existence, who, he also discovered,
had been purposely kept out of the way, on a
former occasion, by some one or other. The
delays were vexatious, and the quirks and turns,
and foldings, and doubles innumerable; but
they came to an end at last, and Mr. Alfred
Bond was obliged in his turn to vacate the old
mansion, in which he had revelled&mdash;a miser in selfish pleasures.</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer than was perhaps necessary
on the <i>minuti</i> of this relation, the principal
events of which are so strongly impressed
upon my memory. But the more I have thought
over the story, the more I have been struck with
the phases and impulses of Sarah Bond's unobtrusive,
but deep feeling mind; her self-sacrificing
spirit, her devotion to her father's will,
her dread, when first in possession of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
property, that any <i>one</i> act of liberality on her part
might be considered a reproach to his memory;
her habits struggling with her feelings, leading
me to the conclusion that she would never have
become, even with the expanding love of her
niece to enlarge her views, thoroughly unmanacled
from the parsimonious habits of her father,
but for her lesson in adversity, which, instead
of teaching as it does a worldly mind, the <i>value
of money</i>, taught her higher nature <i>its proper uses</i>.</p>

<p>It was beautiful to see how Mabel grew into
her aunt's virtues; and even Mr. Goulding was
startled by the energy and thoughtfulness of her
character. She soon convinced Mr. Lycight
that her prospects grew brighter in his love;
and for a time he was romantic enough to wish
she had continued, penniless, and he had been
born a peer, to prove his disinterested affection.
This, however, wore away, as man's romance
always does, and he absolutely became reconciled
to his bride's riches. Sarah Bond was
living a very few years ago, beloved and honoured,
the fountain of prosperity and blessing
to all who needed. There was no useless expenditure, no show, no extravagance in "the
establishment" at the old manor house; but it
was pleasant to perceive the prosperity of the
poor in the immediate neighbourhood; there
was evidence of good heads and kind hearts,
superintending all moral and intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
improvements; there were flourishing schools,
and benevolent societies, and the constant exercise
of individual charities; and many said
that Sarah Bond, and niece, and nephew, did
more good with hundreds than others did with
thousands. From having had practical experience
of poverty, they understood how to remedy
its wants, and minister to its sorrows.
And to the last hour of her prolonged life, Sarah Bond remembered</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p>"There they go!" exclaimed old Mrs. Myles,
looking after two exceedingly beautiful children,
as they passed hand in hand down the street of
the small town of Abbeyweld, to the only school,
that had "Seminary for Young Ladies," written
in large hand, on a proportionably large
card, and placed against the bow window of an
ivied cottage. "There they go!" she repeated;
"and though I'm their grandmother, I may
say a sweeter pair of children than Helen Marsh
and Rose Dillon never trod the main street of
Abbeyweld&mdash;God bless them!" She added
earnestly, "God Almighty bless them!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded a kind voice; and
turning round, Mrs. Myles saw the curate of
the parish, the Reverend Mr. Stokes, standing
just at the entry of her own house. To curtsey
with the respect which in the "good old times"
was customary towards those who "meekly
taught, and led the way," and invite the minister
in, was the work of a moment; the next beheld
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
Mrs. Myles and her visiter tete-a-tete in the
widow's small parlour. It was a cheerful, pleasant
room, such as is often met with in the clean
villages of England. There were two or three
pieces of embroidery, in frames of faded gilding;
an old-fashioned semicircular card-table
stood opposite the window, and upon it rested
a filagree tea-caddy, based by a mark-a-tree
work-box, flanked on one side by the Bible, on
the other by a prayer-book; while on the space
in front was placed "The Whole Art of Cookery,"
by Mrs. Glasse. High-backed chairs of
black mahogany were ranged along the white-washed walls; a corner cupboard displayed
upon its door the magnificence of King Solomon,
and the liberality of the Queen of Sheba,
while within glittered engraved glasses, and
fairy-like cups and saucers, that would delight
the hearts of the fashionables of the present
day. Indeed, Mrs. Myles knew their value,
and prided herself thereon, for whenever the
squire or any great lady paid her a visit, she
was sure, before they entered, to throw the cupboard
door slyly open, so as to display its treasures;
and then a little bit of family pride would
creep out&mdash;"Yes, every one said they were
pretty&mdash;and so she supposed they were&mdash;but
they were nothing to her grandmother's, where
she remembered the servants eating off real India
<i>chaney</i>." The room also contained a high-backed
sofa, covered with chintz; very stately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
hard, and uncomfortable it was to sit upon;
indeed, no one except visiters ever did sit upon
it, save on Sundays, when Helen and Rose were
permitted so to do, "if they kept quiet," which
in truth they seldom did for more than five
minutes together. "Moonlight"&mdash;Mrs. Myles's
large cat&mdash;Moonlight would take a nap there
sometimes; but as Mrs. Myles, while she <i>hushed</i>
him off, declared he was a "clean creature,"
it may be said that Moonlight was the only
thing privileged to <i>enjoy</i> the sofa to his heart's
content. Why he liked it, I could not understand.
Now she invited Mr. Stokes to sit upon
it; but he knew better, and took the window seat in preference.</p>

<p>"They are fine children&mdash;are they not, sir?"
inquired the good old lady, reverting in the
pride of her heart to her young charges. "Rose,
poor thing, will be obliged to shift for herself,
for her father and mother left her almost without
provision: but when Helen's father returns,
I do hope he will be able to introduce her in the
way she seems born for. She has the heart
of a princess&mdash;bless her!" added Mrs. Myles, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I hope, my good friend, she will have a
Christian's heart," said Mr. Stokes.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, sir, certainly, we all have that, I hope."</p>

<p>"I hope so too; but I think you will act
wisely in directing the proud spirit of Helen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
into an humbler channel, while you rouse and
strengthen the modest and retiring one of Rose."</p>

<p>"They are very, very different, sir," said the
old lady, looking particularly sagacious; "I
don't mean as to talent, for they are both very
clever, nor as to goodness, for, thank God, they
are both good; but Helen has such a <i>noble</i>
spirit&mdash;such an uplooking way with her."</p>

<p>"We should all look up to God." said the minister.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course we all do." Mrs. Myles
paused. "She has such a lady-like, independent
way with her, I'm sure she'll turn out something
<i>great</i>, sir. Well, there's no harm in a
little ambition now and then; we all, you know"
want to be a little bit better off than we are."</p>

<p>"We are too apt to indulge in a desire for
what is beyond our reach," said the minister,
gravely; "if every one was to reside on the
hills, who would cultivate the valleys? We
should not forget that godliness, with contentment,
is great gain. It would be far better,
Mrs. Myles, if, instead of struggling to get <i>out
</i> of our sphere, we laboured to do the best we could in it."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, and that's true," replied Mrs.
Myles; "just what I say to Mrs. Jones, who
<i>will</i> give bad sherry at her little tea-parties; good
gooseberry, I say, is better than bad sherry. Will you taste mine, sir?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>

<p>"No, thank you," said the good man, who
at the very moment was pondering over the art
of self-deception, as practised by ourselves <i>upon</i>
ourselves. "No, thank you; but do, my dear
madam, imbue those children with a contented
spirit; there is nothing that keeps us so truly
at peace with the world as contentment&mdash;or with
ourselves, for it teaches peace&mdash;or with a Higher
Power, for it is insulting to His wisdom and love
to go on repining through this beautiful world,
instead of enjoying what as Christians we can
enjoy, and regarding without envy that which we have not."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, good sir. 'Be content,' I said
to Helen only this very morning&mdash;'be content,
my dear, with your pink gingham; <i>who knows
but by and by you may have a silk dress for Sundays</i>?'"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Mrs. Myles, you are sowing bad seed," said the clergyman.</p>

<p>"What, sir, when I told her to be content with the little pink gingham?"</p>

<p>"No; but when you told her she might have
a silk one hereafter. Don't you see, instead of
uprooting you were fostering pride?&mdash;instead
of directing her ambition to a noble object, and
thereby elevating her mind, you were lowering
it by drawing it down to an inferior one?"</p>

<p>"I did not see it," observed Mrs. Myles,
simply; "but you know, sir, there's no more harm in a silk than a cotton."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>

<p>"I must go now, my good lady," said the
minister; "only observing that there <i>is</i> no more
harm in one than in the other, except when the
desire to possess anything beyond our means
leads to discontent, if not to more actively dangerous
faults. I must come and lecture the little maids myself."</p>

<p>"And welcome, sir, and thank you kindly
besides; poor little dears, they have no one to
look after them but me. I daresay I am wrong
sometimes, but I do my best&mdash;I do my best."</p>

<p>The curate thought she did according to her
knowledge, but he lamented that two such exquisitely
beautiful children, possessed of such
natural gifts, should be left to the management
of a vain old woman&mdash;most vain&mdash;though kindly
and good-hearted&mdash;giving kindness with pleasure,
and receiving it with gratitude&mdash;yet totally
unfit to bring up a <i>pair of beauties</i>, who, of all
the female sex, require the most discretion in the management.</p>

<p>"I wonder," thought the Reverend Mr. Stokes&mdash;"I
wonder when our legislature will contrive
to establish a school for mothers. If girls are
sent to school, the chances are that the contamination
over which the teacher can have no
control&mdash;the contamination of evil girls&mdash;renders
them vicious; if, on the contrary, they are
kept at home, the folly of their mothers makes
them fools&mdash;a pretty choice!" Mr. Stokes
turned down a lane that ran parallel with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
garden where the children went to school; and
hearing Helen's voice in loud dispute, he paused
for a moment to ascertain the cause.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the little maid, "Rose may
be what she likes, but I'll be queen."</p>

<p>"How unfit," quoth the curate to himself&mdash;"how
utterly unfit is Mrs. Myles to manage
Helen!" The good man paused again; and
to the no small confusion of the little group,
who had been making holiday under the shadow
of a spreading apple-tree, suddenly entered
amongst them, and read her a lecture, gently,
kindly, and judicious. Having thus performed
what he conceived his duty, he walked on; but
his progress was arrested by a little hand being
thrust into his; and when he looked down, the
beaming, innocent face of Rose Dillon was up-turned towards him.</p>

<p>"Do please, sir," she said, "let Helen Marsh
be queen of the game; if she is not, she won't
play with a bit of heart&mdash;she won't, indeed, sir.
She will play to be sure, but not with any heart."</p>

<p>"I cannot unsay what I have said, little
Rose," he answered; "I cannot; it is better
for her to play without heart, as you call it,
than to have that heart too highly uplifted by play."</p>

<p>Happy would it have been for Helen Marsh
if she had always had a judicious friend to correct
her dangerous ambition. The good curate
admonished the one, and brought forward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
other, of the cousins; but what availed his occasional
admonishing when counteracted by the weak flattery of Mrs. Myles?</p>




<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p>Years passed; the lovely children, who tripped
hand in hand down the street of Abbeyweld,
grew into ripe girlhood, and walked arm in
arm&mdash;the pride and admiration of every villager.
The curate became at last rector, and
Mrs. Myles's absurdities increased with her
years. The perfect beauty of the cousins, both
of face and form, rendered them celebrated far
and near. Each had a separate character as
from the first; and yet&mdash;but that Rose Dillon
was a little shorter than her cousin Helen
Marsh, and that the <i>expression</i> of her eyes was
so different that it was almost impossible to believe
they were the same shape and colour, the
cousins might have been mistaken for each
other&mdash;I say <i>might</i>, because it is rather remarkable
that they never were. Helen's fine dark
eyes had a lofty and forbidding aspect, while
Rose had not the power, if indeed she ever entertained
the will, of looking either the one or
the other. I thought Rose the most graceful of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
the two in her carriage, but there could be no
doubt as to Helen's being the most dignified;
both girls were almost rustic in their manners,
but rusticity and vulgarity are very distinct in
their feelings and attributes. They <i>could not</i>
do or say aught that was vulgar or at variance
with the kindnesses of life&mdash;those tender nothings
which make up so large a something in
the account of every day's existence. Similar,
withal, as the cousins were in appearance, they
grew up as dissimilar in feelings and opinions
as it is possible to conceive, and yet loving each
other dearly. Still Helen never for a moment
fancied that any one in the village of Abbeyweld
could compete with her in any way. She had
never questioned herself as to this being the
case, but the idea had been nourished since her
earliest infancy&mdash;had never been disputed, except
perhaps when latterly a town belle, or even
a more conceited specimen, a country belle, visited
in the neighbourhood; but popular voice
(and there <i>is</i> a popular voice, be it loud or gentle,
everywhere) soon discovered that blonde,
and feathers, and flowers, had a good deal to do
with this disturbing of popular opinion; and
after a few days, the good people invariably
returned to their allegiance. "Ah! ah!" old
Mrs. Myles would observe on these occasions&mdash;Ah!
ah!"&mdash;I told you they'd soon find the
fair lady was shaded by her fine laces. I daresay
now she's on the look-out for a good match,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
poor thing! Not that Helen is handsome&mdash;don't
look in the glass, Helen, child! My
grandmother always said that Old Nick stood
behind every young lady's shoulder when she
looked in the glass, with a rouge-pot all ready to
make her look handsomer in her own eyes than
she really was; which shows how wicked it is
to look much in a glass. Only a little sometimes,
Nell, darling&mdash;we'll forgive her for looking
<i>a little</i>; but certainly when I looked at the
<i>new</i> beauty in church the other day, and then
looked, I know where, I thought&mdash;but no matter,
Helen, no matter&mdash;I don't want to make either of my girls <i>vain</i>."</p>

<p>Why Mrs. Myles so decidedly preferred Helen
to Rose, appeared a mystery to all who did not
know the secret sympathy, the silent unsatisfied
ambition, that lurked in the bosoms of both the
old and the young. Mrs. Myles had lived for a
long time upon the reputation of her own beauty;
and whenever she needed <i>sympathy</i> (a food
which the weak-minded devour rapidly,) she lamented
to one or two intimates, while indulging
in the luxury of <i>tea</i>, that she was an ill-used
person, simply because she had not been a baronet's
lady at the very least. Helen's ambition
echoed that of her grandmother; it was not the
longing of a village lass for a new bonnet or a
brilliant dress&mdash;it was an ambition of sufficient
strength to have sprung up in a castle. She
resolved to be something beyond what she was;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
and there are very few who have strength to
give birth to, and cherish up a resolve, who will
not achieve a purpose, be it for good or bad, for
weal or for wo. Rose was altogether and perfectly
simple and single-hearted: conscious that
she was an orphan, dependent upon her grandmother's
slender annuity for support, and that
Helen's father could not provide both for his
daughter and his niece, her life was one of patient
industry and unregretted privation. Before
she was fifteen, she had persuaded her
grandmother to part with her serving maiden,
and with very little assistance from Helen, she
performed the labours of their cottage, aided
twice a-week by an elderly woman, who often
declared that such another girl as Rose Dillon
was not to be found in the country. Both were
now verging on seventeen, and Helen received
the addresses of a young farmer in the neighbourhood&mdash;a
youth of excellent yeoman family,
and of superior education and manners.</p>

<p>The cousins walked out one evening together,
and Rose turned into the lane where they used frequently to meet Edward Lynne.</p>

<p>"No, Rose," said Helen, "not there; I am
not in a humour to meet Edward to-night."</p>

<p>"But you said you would," said Rose.</p>

<p>"Well, do not look so solemn about it. I
daresay I did&mdash;but lover's promises&mdash;if indeed
we are lovers. Do you know, Rose, I should
be very much obliged to you to take Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
off my hands&mdash;he is just the husband for you, so rustic and quiet."</p>

<p>"Edward to be taken off your hands, Helen!&mdash;Edward
Lynne!&mdash;the protector of our childhood&mdash;the
pride of the village&mdash;the very companion
of Mr. Stokes&mdash;why, he dined with him
last Sunday! Edward Lynne! You jest, cousin!
and"&mdash; Rose Dillon paused suddenly, for
she was going to add, "You ought not to jest
with me." She checked herself in time; stooped
down to gather some flowers to hide her agitation;
felt her cheeks flush, her heart beat, her
head swim, and then a chill creep through her
frame. Helen had unconsciously awoke the
hope which Rose had never dared to confess
unto herself. The waking was ecstatic; but
she knew the depth of Edward's love for Helen.
She had been his confidant&mdash;she believed it was
a jest&mdash;how could her cousin do otherwise than
love Edward Lynne? And with this belief, she
recovered the self-possession which the necessity
for subduing her feelings had taught her even at that early age.</p>

<p>"And Rose," said Helen, in a quiet voice,
"did you really think I ever intended to marry Edward Lynne?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, cousin. Why, you love him, do
you not! Besides, he is rich&mdash;very rich in comparison
to you&mdash;very, very rich. And if he
were not&mdash;oh, Helen!&mdash;is he not in himself&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
I need not reason&mdash;you are in your usual
high spirits, and say what you do not mean."</p>

<p>"I do not, Rose, now, at all events. Last
evening, Edward was so earnest, so affectionate,
so very earnest, it is pleasant to have a true and
faithful lover; but I should not quite like to
break his heart&mdash;it would not be friendly, knowing
him so long; for indeed," she added, gaily,
"though I don't like Edward Lynne well enough
to marry him, I like him too well to break his heart in downright earnest."</p>

<p>There are women cold and coquettish by nature.
The disposition flourishes best in courtly
scenes, but it will grow anywhere, ay, and
flourish anywhere. It unfortunately requires
but little culture; still Helen was in her novitiate.
If she had not been so, she would not
have cared whether Edward broke his heart or not.</p>

<p>"But Helen," stammered Rose, "surely&mdash;you&mdash;you have been very wrong."</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;I know&mdash;there, don't you <i>hear
me</i> say I know it, and yet your lecturing face is
as long as ever. Surely," she continued pettishly,
"I confess my crime; and even Mr. Stokes
says, when confessed it is amended."</p>

<p>"Helen!" exclaimed Rose suddenly; "Helen!&mdash;if
what you have now said is really true,
you have only told me half the truth. Helen
Marsh, you have seen some one you like better than Edward Lynne."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>

<p>"No!" was Helen's prompt reply, for she
would not condescend to a falsehood&mdash;her own
pride was a sufficient barrier against that. "No,
Rose, I have not seen any one I like better than Edward. But, Rose"&mdash;She buried her
face in her hands, and as suddenly withdrew
them, and shaking back her luxuriant ringlets,
while a bright triumphant colour mounted to
her cheeks, added&mdash;"There is no reason <i>why</i>
I should be ashamed. I saw, last week, at
Mrs. Howard's, one whom I would rather marry."</p>

<p>"I always thought," murmured Rose, weeping
in the fulness of her generous nature, as the
idea of Edward's future misery came upon her&mdash;"I
always thought no good would come of
your visiting a lady so much above us." It
would be impossible to describe the contemptuous
expression of Helen's finely moulded features,
while she repeated, as if to herself, "Above
<i>us</i>!&mdash;above <i>me</i>!" And then she added aloud,
and with what seemed to Rose a forced expression
of joy, "But good <i>will</i> come of it, Rose&mdash;good
will surely come of it; never fear but it
will&mdash;it <i>must</i>. And when I am a great lady,
Rosey, who but you, sweet cousin, will be next my heart?"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied to be <i>near</i>, even without being
<i>next</i> it, Helen," she replied mournfully; "but
why have you kept this matter concealed from me so long? Why have you"&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

<p>"Found!" interrupted a well-known voice;
and at the same moment Edward Lynne shook
a shower of perfumed hawthorn blossoms from
the scattered hedge which he struggled through;
and repeating "Found!" in his full echoing
voice, stood panting before the startled girls.
"I have had such a hunt!" he exclaimed joyfully&mdash;"such a hunt for you, Helen! I have
been over Woodland brook, and up as far as
Fairmill, where you said you would be&mdash;oh,
you truant! And I doubt if I should have
caught you at last, but for poor Dash"&mdash;and
the sagacious dog sprung about, as if conscious
that he deserved a large portion of the praise.
Rose was astonished at the perfect self-possession
with which, after the first flush of surprise,
Helen received her lover. Nor was poor Rose
unconscious that she herself occupied no portion
of his attention beyond the glance of recognition
which he cast while throwing himself on the sward at Helen's feet.</p>

<p>"We must go home," said the triumphant
beauty, after hearing a few of those half-whispered
nothings which are considered of such
importance in a lover's calendar; "the dew is falling, and I may catch cold."</p>

<p>"The dew falling!" repeated Edward.&mdash;"Why,
look, the sky is still golden from the
sun's rays; do not&mdash;do not, dearest Helen, go
home yet. Besides," he added, "your grandmother has plenty of employment; there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
Mrs. Howard's companion, and one or two
strangers from the hall, at your cottage&mdash;so she is not at all lonesome."</p>

<p>"Who did you say?" inquired Helen, eagerly,
now really losing her self-command.</p>

<p>"Oh, some of Mrs. Howard's fine friends. I
never," he continued, "see those sort of people
in an humble village, without thinking of the
story of the agitation of all the little hedgerow
birds, when they first saw a paroquet amongst
them, and began longing for his gay feathers.
Do not go, dear Helen&mdash;they will soon be gone;
and I do so want you to walk as far as Fairmill
Lawn. I have planted with my own hands this
morning the silver firs you said you admired,
just where the bank juts over the stream. Do come."</p>

<p>"Rose will go, and tell me all about it, but <i>I</i>
must get home. Granny cannot do without
me; besides, Mrs. Howard is so kind to me,
that I cannot suffer <i>her</i> friends to be neglected.
Nay, Edward, you may look as you please, but
I certainly <i>shall</i> go." Edward Lynne remonstrated,
implored, and, finally, flew into a passion.
At any other time Helen's proud spirit
would have risen so as to meet this outburst of
temper with one to the full as violent; but the
knowledge of what had grown to maturity in
her own mind, and the presence of Rose, restrained
her, and she continued to walk home without reply.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

<p>"And I shall go also," he said, bitterly, "but
not with you." Even at that moment Helen Marsh
exulted in her own mind to find his words and his
steps at variance; he was still by her side. The
most perilous of all triumphs is the knowledge of
possessing power over the affections of our fellow
creatures; it is so especially intoxicating
to women as to be greatly dangerous, and those
who do not abuse such power deserve much
praise. Rose walked timidly behind them,
wondering how Helen could have imagined
any alliance in the world more brilliant&mdash;but
no, that was not the idea&mdash;any alliance in the
world so <i>happy</i> as that with Edward Lynne
must be. When they reached the commencement
of the village, Edward said, for the fifth
or sixth time, "Then you will go, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Very well, Helen. Good evening."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Edward," was the cool reply.
Not one word of adieu did he bestow on
Rose as he dashed into another path; while his
dog stood for a moment, uncertain as to whether
his master would return or not, and then rapidly followed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen! what have you done?" murmured
Rose. Helen replied by one of those low
murmuring laughs which sound like the very
melody of love; and the two girls, in a few
moments more, were in their own cottage,
where Rose saw that evening, for the first time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
the gentleman whom Helen had declared she
did not prefer to Edward, though she would rather marry him.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p>I think I have said before that the most trying
and dangerous position a young woman
can occupy, is that where her station is not defined&mdash;where
she considers herself above the
industrious classes by whom she is surrounded&mdash;and
where those with whom her tastes and
habits assimilate, consider her greatly beneath
them. Superficial observers (and the great
mass of human beings are nothing more) invariably
look for happiness in the class one or
two degrees above their own. They would
consider themselves absurd if they <i>at once</i> set
their minds upon being dukes and princes; they
only want to be a <i>little</i> bit higher, only the
<i>smallest bit</i>, and never for a moment look to
what they call "<i>beneath</i> them" for happiness.
This was particularly the case with these young
girls. Their station was not defined, yet how
different their practice! One was ambitious
of the glittering tinsel of the world&mdash;the other,
refined but not ambitious, sought her happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
in the proper exercise of the affections; neither
could have described her particular feelings,
but an accurate observer could not fail to do so
for them. That night neither girl had courage
to speak to the other on the occurrences of the
past day, and yet each thought of nothing else.
They knelt down, side by side, as they had done
from infancy, repeating the usual prayers as
they had been accustomed to do. Helen's
voice did not falter, but continued its unvaried
tone to the end: Rose (Helen thought) delivered
the petition of "lead us not into temptation"
with deeper feeling than usual; and instead
of rising when Helen rose, and exchanging
with her the kiss of sisterly affection, Rose buried
her face in her hands; while her cousin,
seated opposite the small glass which stood on
their little dressing-table, commenced curling
her hair, as if that day, which had completed a
revolution in her way of thinking, had been as
smooth as all the other days of her short calendar.
The candle was extinguished, and Helen
slept profoundly. The moon shone in brightly
through the latticed window, whose leaden
cross-bars chequered the sanded floor. Rose
looked earnestly upon the face of the sleeper,
and so bright it was, that she saw, or fancied
she saw, a smile of triumph curling on her lip.
She crept quietly out of bed, and leaned her
throbbing temples against the cool glass. How
deserted the long street of Abbeyweld appeared;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>
the shadows of the opposite trees and houses
lay prostrate across the road&mdash;the aspect of the
village street was lonely, very lonely and sad&mdash;there
was no hum from the school&mdash;no inquisitive
eyes peeped from the casements&mdash;no echoing
steps upon the neatly-gravelled footpath&mdash;the
old elm-tree showed like a mighty giant,
standing out against the clear calm sky&mdash;and
there was one star, only one, sparkling amid its
branches&mdash;a diamond of the heavens, shedding
its brightness on the earth. The stillness was
positively oppressive. Rose felt as if every time
she inhaled the air, she disturbed the death-like
quiet of the scene. A huge shadow passed along
the ledge of the opposite cottage; her nerves
were so unstrung that she started back as it advanced.
It was only their own gentle cat,
whose quick eye recognised its mistress, and
without waiting for invitation, crawled quickly
from its eminence, and came rubbing itself
against the glass, and then moved stealthily
away, intent upon the destruction of some unsuspicious
creature, who, taught by nature, believes that with night comes safety.</p>

<p>Almost at the end of the street, the darkness
was as it were divided by a ray of light, that
neither flickered nor wavered. What a picture
it brought at once before her!&mdash;the pale, lame
grandchild of old Jenny Oram, watching by the
dying bed of the only creature that had ever
loved her&mdash;her poor deaf grandmother. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
the girl's great trouble was, that the old woman
could neither see to read the Word of God herself,
nor hear her when she read it to her; but
the lame girl had no time to waste with grief,
so she plied her needle rapidly through the night-watches,
not daring to shed a tear upon the
work, or damp her needle with a sigh. Rose
was not as sorry for her as she would have been
at any other time, for individual sorrow has few
sympathies; but the more she thought of the
lonely lame girl, the less became her own trouble,
and she might have gone to bed with the
consciousness which, strange to say, brings consolation,
that there was one very near more
wretched than herself, had she not seen the form
of Edward Lynne glide like a spectre from beneath
the old elm-tree, and stand before the
window. Rose retreated, but still observed him;
the moon was shining on the window, so he
must have seen the form, without, perhaps, being
able to distinguish whose it was. Rose watched
him until his silent death-like presence oppressed
her heart and brain, and she closed her
eyes to shut out what had become too painful
to look upon. When she looked again, all was
sleeping in the moonlight as before; but he was
gone. At the same moment Helen turned restlessly
on her pillow, and sobbed and muttered
to herself. Rose felt that pillow wet with tears.
"Helen!" she exclaimed; "Helen, dear
Helen! awake! Awake, Helen!" Her cousin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
at length aroused, flung her arms around her
neck; and the proud lip which she had left
curled with the consciousness of beauty and
power, quivered and paled, while she sank awake and weeping on Rose's bosom.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<p>Never had the bells of Abbeyweld, within the
memory of living man&mdash;within the memory of
old Mrs. Myles herself, and <i>she</i> was the oldest
living woman in the parish&mdash;rung so merry a
peal as on the morning that Helen Marsh was
married to the handsome and Honourable Mr.
Ivers. He was young as well as handsome&mdash;honourable both by name and nature&mdash;rich in
possession and expectancy. On his part it was
purely and entirely what is called a "love
match"&mdash;one of the strangest of all strange
things perpetrated by a young man of rank and
fashion. His wealth and position in society enabled
him to select for himself; and he did so,
of course, to the disappointment of as many,
or perhaps a greater number of mothers than
daughters, inasmuch as it is the former whose
speculations are the deepest laid and most dangerous in arts matrimonial.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>

<p>Every body was astonished. Mrs. Howard&mdash;Helen's "kind friend"&mdash;Mrs. Howard, little
short of distracted for three weeks at the very
least, did nothing but exclaim, "Who would
have thought it!" "Who, indeed!" was the
reply, in various tones of sympathy, envy, and
surprise. Poor Mrs. Howard, to the day of
her death, never suffered another portionless
beauty to enter her doors while even the shadow
of an eldest son rested on its threshold. Mrs.
Myles was of course in an ecstacy of delight;
her prophecy was fulfilled. Helen, <i>her</i> Helen,
was the honourable wife of a doubly honourable
man. What triumphant glances did she
cast over the railings of the communion-table
at Mr. Stokes&mdash;with what an air she marched
down the aisle&mdash;how patronising and condescending was her manner to those neighbours
whom she considered her inferiors&mdash;how bitterly
did she lament that the Honourable Mr.
Ivers would not have any one to breakfast with
them but Mr. Stokes&mdash;and how surpassingly,
though silently, angry was she with Mr. Stokes
for not glorying with her when the bride and
bridegroom drove off in their "own carriage,"
leaving her in a state of prideful excitement,
and Rose Dillon in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"Well, sir!" exclaimed the old lady&mdash;"well,
sir, you see it <i>has</i> turned out exactly as I said
it would; there's station&mdash;there's happiness.
Why, sir, if his brother dies without children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
his own valet told me, Mr. Ivers would be a
lord and Helen a lady. Didn't she look beautiful!
Now, please, reverend sir, do speak, didn't she look beautiful?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"Ah! it's a great gift that beauty; though,"
she added, resorting to the strain of morality
which persons of her character are apt to consider
a salve for sin&mdash;"though it's all vanity, all
vanity. 'Flesh is grass'&mdash;a beautiful text that
was your reverence preached from last Sunday&mdash;'All
flesh is grass.' Ah, well-a-day! so it
is. We ought not to be puffed up or conceited&mdash;no,
no. As I said to Mrs. Leicester, 'Don't
be puffed up, my good woman, because your
niece has what folk call a pretty face, nor don't
expect that she's to make a good market of it&mdash;it's
but skin deep; remember our good rector's
sermon, 'All flesh is grass.'' Ah, deary me!
people do need such putting in mind; and, if
you believe me, sir, unless indeed it be Rose,
poor child, who never had a bit of love in her
head yet, I'll be bound every girl is looking
above her station&mdash;there's a pity, sir. All are
not born with a coach and horses; no, no;"
and so, stimulated a little, perhaps, by a glass
of <i>real</i>, not gooseberry, champagne, poor Mrs.
Myles would have galloped on with a strange
commentary upon her own conduct (of the motives
to which she was perfectly ignorant,) had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>
not the rector suddenly exclaimed, "Where is Rose?"</p>

<p>"Crying in her own room, I'll be bound;
I'm sure she is. Why, Rose&mdash;and I really
must get your reverence to speak to her, she is
a sad girl&mdash;Rose Dillon, I say&mdash;so silent and
homely-like&mdash;ah, dear! Why, granddaughter&mdash;now,
is it not undutiful of her, good sir, when
she knows how much I have suffered parting from my Helen. Rose Dillon!"</p>

<p>But Rose Dillon was not weeping in her
room, nor did she hear her grandmother's voice
when the carriage, that bore the bride to a new
world, drove off. Rose ran down the garden,
intending to keep the equipage in sight as long
as it could be distinguished from an eminence
that was called the Moat, and which commanded
an extensive view of the high road. There
was a good deal of brushwood creeping up the
elevation, and at one side it was overshadowed
by several tall trees; in itself it was a sweet,
sequestered spot, a silent watching place. She
could hardly hear the carriage wheels, though
she saw it whirled along, just as it passed within
sight of the tall trees. Helen's arm, with its
glittering bracelet, waved an adieu; this little
act of remembrance touched Rose, and, falling
on her knees, she sobbed forth a prayer, earnest
and heartfelt, for her cousin's happiness.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Rose!" exclaimed the trembling
voice of the discarded lover, who, pale and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
wo-worn, had been unintentionally concealed
among the trees&mdash;"God bless you, Rose!&mdash;that
prayer has done me good. Amen to every word
of it! She is quite, quite gone now&mdash;another's
bride&mdash;the wife of a gentleman&mdash;and so best;
the ambition which fits her for her present station
unfitted her to be my wife. I say this, and
think this&mdash;I know it! But though I do know
it, her face&mdash;that face I loved from infancy, until
it became a sin for me to love it longer&mdash;that
face comes between me and reason, and its
brightness destroys all that reason taught."</p>

<p>Rose could not trust herself to reply. She
longed to speak to him, but she could not; she
<i>dared</i> not. He continued&mdash;"Did she leave no
message, speak no word, say nothing, to be said to me?"</p>

<p>"She said," replied her cousin, "that she
hoped you would be happy; that you deserved to be so"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Deserved to be so!" he repeated bitterly;
"and that was the reason why <i>she</i> made me
miserable. Oh! the folly, the madness of the
man who trusts to woman's love&mdash;to woman's
faith! But the spell <i>once</i> broken, the charm
once dispelled, that is enough!" And yet it
was not enough, for Edward talked on, and
more than once was interrupted by Rose, who,
whenever she could vindicate her cousin, did so
bravely and generously&mdash;not in a half-consenting,
frigid manner, but as a true woman does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
when she defends a woman, as, if she be either good or wise, she will always do.</p>

<p>Rose did not know enough of human nature
to understand that the more Edward complained
of Helen's conduct and desertion, the less he
really felt it; and the generous portion of his
own nature sympathised with the very generosity
which he argued against. He had found
one, who while she listened sweetly and patiently
to his complaints, vindicated, precisely as he
would have desired, the idol of his heart's first
love. What we love appears so entirely our
own, that we question the right of others to
blame it, whatever we may do ourselves. If he
had known the deep, the treasured secret that
poor Rose concealed within the sanctuary of her
bosom, he would have wondered at the unostentatious
generosity of her pure and simple nature.</p>

<p>"It is evident," said Rose Dillon to herself,
when she bade Edward adieu; "it is quite evident
he never will or can love another. Such
affection is everlasting." How blind she was!
"Poor fellow! he will either die in the flower
of his age of a broken heart, or drag on a miserable
existence! And if he does," questioned
the maiden, "and if he does, <i>what is that to
me</i>?" She did not, for a moment or two, trust
herself to frame an answer, though the tell-tale
blood, first mounting to and then receding
from her cheek, replied; but then she began to
calculate how long she had known Edward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
and thought how very natural it was she should
feel interested, deeply interested, in him. He
had no sister; why should she not be to him a
sister? Ah, Rose, Rose! that sisterly reasoning
is of all others the most perilous.</p>

<p>Time passed on. The bride wrote a letter,
which, in its tone and character, sounded pretty
much like a long trumpet-note of exultation.
Mrs. Myles declared it to be a dear letter, a
charming letter, a most lady-like letter, and yet
evidently she was not satisfied therewith. She
read scraps of it to all the neighbours, and
vaunted Mrs. Ivers, the Honourable Mrs. Ivers,
up to the skies. Like all persons whose dignity
and station are not the result of inheritance,
in the next epistle she was even more anxious
to impress her humble relatives with an idea of
her consequence. Mingled with a few epithets
of love, were a great many eulogiums on her
new station. She was too honest to regret, even
in seeming, the rural delights of the country,
(for Helen could not stoop to deceit,) but she
gave a list of titled visitors, and said she would
write more at length, were it not that every
spare moment was spent in qualifying herself
to fill her station so as to do credit to her husband."
This old Mrs. Myles could not understand;
she considered Helen fit to be a queen, and said so.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>




<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<p>For more than two months, Rose and Edward
did not meet again; for more than four
after that, he never entered the cottage which
had contained what he held most dear on earth;
but one evening he called with Mr. Stokes. The
good rector might have had his own reasons for
bringing the young man to the cottage; but if
he had he kept them to himself, the best way of rendering them effective.</p>

<p>After that, Edward often came, sometimes
with a book from the rectory, sometimes with a
newspaper for Mrs. Myles, sometimes to know
if he could do anything for the old lady in the
next town, where he was going, sometimes for
one thing, sometimes for another, but always
with some excuse, which Rose was happy to
accept as the true one; satisfied that she could
see him, hear him, know that he was there.</p>

<p>It so chanced that, calling one evening (evening
calls are suspicious where young people are
concerned,) Edward was told that Mrs. Myles
had gone over to Lothery, the next post town,
and that Miss Rose was out. The servant
(ever since Helen's marriage, Mrs. Myles had
thought it due to her dignity to employ such a
person) said this with an air of mystery, and
Edward inquired which way Miss Rose had walked. Indeed, she did not know.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>

<p>Edward therefore trusted to chance, and he
had not gone very far down a lane leading to
the common of Abbeyweld, when he saw her
seated under a tree (where heroines are surely
found at some period or other of their life's
eventful history) reading a letter. Of course he
interrupted her, and then apologised.</p>

<p>"The letter," said Rose, frankly, "is from poor Helen."</p>

<p>"Why do you call her poor?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Because she is very ill; and I am going to her to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Ill!&mdash;to-morrow!&mdash;so suddenly&mdash;so soon!" stammered Edward.</p>

<p>Rose turned homewards with an air of cold
constraint. She could not attribute Edward's
agitation to any other cause than his anxiety on
Helen's account, and the conviction gave her intense pain.</p>

<p>"Stay, Rose," he said. Rose walked steadily
forward. "There is," he continued bitterly,
"a curse, a spell upon this place. Do you not
remember that it was here&mdash;<i>here</i>, within five
yards of where we stand&mdash;that <i>she</i> first&mdash;.
But where's the use of thinking of <i>that</i>, or any
thing else," he exclaimed with a sudden burst
of passion, "where a woman is concerned?
They are all, <i>all</i> alike, and I am a double fool!
But go, Rose, go&mdash;enjoy her splendour, and lie
in wait, as she did, for some rich idiot!"</p>

<p>It was now Rose's turn to interrupt. Turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
upon Edward, with an expression of deeply
insulted feeling, "Sir," she said; and before
she proceeded the cold monosyllable had entered
his heart; "Sir, my cousin Helen did <i>not</i> lie
in wait; a woman's beauty may be called a
snare, if you please, but it is not one of her own
making; she was sought and won, and not by
an <i>idiot</i>; and it is ungenerous in you to speak
thus now, when time, and her being another's wife"&mdash;</p>

<p>Poor Rose had entered on perilous ground,
and she felt it, and the feeling prevented her proceeding.
She trembled violently; and if Edward
could have seen her blanched cheek and
quivering lip, he would have checked his impetuosity,
and bitterly reproached himself for
the rash words he had uttered. If he could
but have known how devoutly the poor fond
beating heart loved him at that moment, he
would, rustic though he was, have fallen at her
feet, and entreated her forgiveness. Doubtless
it was better as it was, for if men could see into
women's hearts, I very much fear their reliance
on their own power would increase, and <i>that</i>
would be neither pleasant nor profitable to themselves
or others; the very existence of love often
depends on its uncertainty. Some evil star at
that moment shed its influence over them, for
Edward Lynne, catching at Rose's words, answered,</p>

<p>"You need not, I assure you, entertain your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
cousin with an account of how I grieve; and
remember, believe me, I take good care to prevent
any woman's caprice from having power over me a second time."</p>

<p>"You do quite right," replied Rose&mdash;"quite
right." They walked on together until they
arrived within sight of the cottage door, but neither spoke.</p>

<p>"I have a great deal to do&mdash;much to prepare.
I must wish you good-night. Good-bye, and a kinder&mdash;temper." She faltered.</p>

<p>"Going," said Edward&mdash;"going away in
such haste; and to part thus. There must be
some mistake. I have watched you narrowly,
suspiciously, as men do who have been once
deceived; and I have seen no trace of unwomanly ambition in you; I little thought
you would, on the slightest hint, so willingly
embrace the first opportunity of entering into
the sphere I thought you dreaded&mdash;as I do."</p>

<p>"I told you Helen was ill."</p>

<p>"A megrim&mdash;a whim&mdash;a"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do her wrong; she has been a mother, and her child is dead."</p>

<p>"A blow to her ambition," said Edward, so
coldly that Rose (such is human nature) breathed
more freely. Was it possible, then&mdash;<i>could</i>
it be possible&mdash;that his feelings had been excited
not by the remembrance of Helen, but the
thought of her own departure? Yet still her
simple sense of justice urged her to say, "Again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
you do her wrong; Helen has a great deal of feeling."</p>

<p>"For herself," he answered tersely, "I dare say she has."</p>

<p>"I did not think you could be so unjust and
ungenerous," replied Rose; "but you are out
of sorts to-night, and will be sorry before morning.
You were always hasty, Edward. Good-night&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then, Rose&mdash;good-bye;" and
without taking her hand, without one kind
word, one sign of love, Edward Lynne rushed
through the garden gate and disappeared.</p>

<p>Rose entered the little parlour, which of late
had been well cared for. The old sofa, though
as stiff and hard as ever, triumphed in green
and yellow; and two cushions, with large yellow
tassels, graced the ends, and a huge square
ottoman, which every country visitor invariably
tumbled over, stood exactly in front of the old
seat. Upon this Rose flung herself, and, covering
her face with her hands, bent down her
head upon the stately seat. Her sobs were not
loud but deep; and as she was dealing with
feelings, and not with time, she had no idea
how long she had remained in that state, until
aroused by a voice, whose every tone sent the
blood throbbing and tingling through her veins.</p>

<p>"Rose&mdash;dear Rose!"</p>

<p>Blushing&mdash;trembling&mdash;ashamed of an emotion
she had not the power to control&mdash;Rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
could not move, did not at all events, until Edward
was on his knees beside her&mdash;until he had
poured forth his affection&mdash;had assured her how
completely she had possessed herself of his respect
and admiration; that his feelings towards
her not being of that passionate nature which
distracted him with love for Helen, he had not
truly felt her value until the idea of losing her
for ever came upon him; that then he indeed
felt as though all hope of happiness was to be
taken away for ever&mdash;felt that he should lose a
friend, one on whose principles and truth he
could rely&mdash;felt that in <i>her</i> his all was concentrated.
It is only those who, having loved long
and hopelessly for years, find that love returned,
and at the very moment when they were
completely bowed down by the weight of disappointment,
can understand what Rose experienced.
She did not violate any of the laws of
maiden modesty, because she was pure in heart
and single of purpose; but she was too truthful
to withhold the confession of her love, and
too sincere to conceal her happiness.</p>

<p>"I will give you a promise; but receive none,"
said the generous lover. "I should be indeed
miserable if I, for a moment, fancied you were
controlled only by a <i>promise. I rely upon you
solely and entirely</i>; no matter with what temptations
you may be surrounded. If Helen is so
much admired, you must be admired also; but
I do not fear you will forget me; for now my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
only astonishment is how I could have preferred
the spirit and power of the one to the tender
and womanly grace of the other." In the
midst of these effusions, so dear to lovers' hearts,
Mrs. Myles entered. Many and many a time
had she prayed that Edward Lynne might transfer
his affections to Rose Dillon; it would be
such "a capital match for her, poor thing." She
would repeat to herself, "<i>Yes</i>, quite the thing
for <i>her</i>, though, of course, for Helen I could not
hear of it&mdash;yet quite the thing of all others for
her." This frame of mind continued until the
invitation arrived, and it was determined that
Rose should visit her cousin. "It is," argued
the good woman in her own way, "it is only
to nurse her strong and well again, I dare say;
but yet, who knows, she may see some one, or
some one may see her? She certainly is a very
pretty, modest-looking girl; and I have heard
say that modest-looking girls are sometimes
greatly admired among the grandees in fashionable
places, because of their rarity. I shall certainly
show the cold shoulder to Edward Lynne
the next time he comes, and give him a hint as
to the expectations I have for Rose. I must
not suffer the poor child to throw herself away&mdash;oh
no!&mdash;oh no! Edward Lynne is a very
nice young man certainly; and if Rose had not
been going to London"&mdash; She opened the
parlour door as she so reasoned; and the peculiar
expression which passed over the countenances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
of both, convinced her that every thing
was proceeding in opposition to her "prudential
motives." Edward frankly expounded all, to
her entire dissatisfaction. "She did not," she
said, "at all approve of engagements; she
would not sanction any engagement except at
the altar; she thought <i>Mr.</i> Lynne (Mr. Lynne!
she had never in her life before called him any
thing but "Ned") she thought he ought to have
spoken to <i>her</i> first as became <i>a gentleman</i>."
And Edward, provoked beyond bearing at what
always upstirs a noble soul&mdash;mere worldly-mindedness&mdash;replied,
"that he never professed
to be a <i>gentleman</i>; he was, and ever would be,
a farmer, and nothing more; and for all that,
he thought a farmer&mdash;an honest, upright, English
farmer&mdash;might have as correct ideas as to
right and wrong as any gentleman." At this
Mrs. Myles became very indignant; like the
frog in the fable, she endeavoured to think herself
an ox, and talked and looked magnificence
itself, until at last she felt as if being <i>her</i> grand-children
was enough to entitle Helen and Rose
to sit before a queen. She talked of Edward,&mdash;his
occupation, his barns, his cows, horses,
and sheep&mdash;until Rose, all gentle as she was,
roused, and said, that for herself she had no
ambition beyond that of being the useful wife of
an honest man; that Edward had honoured
her, and, sorry as she should be to displease the
only parent she had ever known, she had plighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
her faith in the temple of her own heart to
him&mdash;and as long as the plight was of value in
his eyes, it could not be withdrawn. How truly
did Edward Lynne feel that she indeed would
be a crown of glory to his old age, as well as to his manhood's prime!</p>

<p>The scene&mdash;for there are "scenes" wherever
human passion runs wild&mdash;ended by Mrs.
Myles working herself into the belief that she
was the most ill-used old lady in the British dominions.
She commanded Edward from her
presence; and though Rose wept and knelt at
her feet, she refused to be pacified, declaring
that if it had not been for the rheumatism, she
would herself act as nurse to Helen, and not
suffer so low-minded a creature as Rose Dillon
to look on the splendour of her cousin's house.
What she thought of that splendour, an extract
from a letter&mdash;not the first or second&mdash;which
replied to those she had received from Edward, will best tell:</p>

<p>"I have seen a great deal to astonish&mdash;every
thing seems wonderful in London&mdash;only I wish
the people seemed more really happy. I have
been thinking that happiness is not a sudden
thing like joy; it is more quiet&mdash;<i>it takes time to
be happy</i>&mdash;and the people here have no time.
In the midst of the gayest party, they do not
suffer themselves to enjoy it, but keep hurrying
on to the next. I remember when we were
children, Helen and I, we have sat an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
over a bunch of wildflowers, yet not discovered
half their beauties; surely excitement and
happiness are not twin-born. Since Helen has
been better, numbers of ladies have called, so
beautifully dressed, and so gentle-mannered and
reserved, one so very like the other, that they
might have all been brought up at the same
school. They never appear to confide in each
other, but make a talk, after their own calm fashion,
about small things. Still, when they talk,
<i>they do not say much</i>, considering how highly
bred they are. I have listened throughout an
entire morning (a fashionable morning, Edward,
does not begin until three o'clock in the
afternoon), and really could not remember a
single observation made by a drawing-room full
of ladies. <i>We</i> could not talk ten minutes with
dear Mr. Stokes, without hearing something
that we could not help remembering all the days
of our lives. It is wonderful how superior Helen
is (I am not afraid to tell you so) to every
one around her; there is a natural loftiness of
mind and manner visible in her every movement,
that carries off her want of those pretty
accomplishments which the ladies value so
highly. And then she is <i>so</i> beautiful, and her
husband is so proud of having the handsomest
woman in London for his wife; and one artist
begs to model her ear, another her hand&mdash;you
cannot think how fair and soft and 'do-nothing'
it looks,&mdash;and as to her portraits, they are in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
those pretty painted books which Mr. Stokes
calls 'vanities.' There is a queer, quirky, little
old gentleman who visits here, who said that
Helen owed her great success in society to her
'tact.' Oh! Edward, she owes her sorrow to
her <i>ambition</i>. Would you believe it possible
that she, the beauty of Abbeyweld, who for so
long a time seemed to us satisfied with that distinction,
is not satisfied now. Why, there is
not such an establishment, no, not at Mrs. Howard's,
as that which she commands. Oh! Edward,
to have once loved Helen, is to be interested
for her always; there is something great
in her very faults; there is nothing poor or low
about her. That little cranky old gentleman
said the other evening while looking at her,
'Miss Rose, a woman, to be happy, should
either have no ambition, or an ambition beyond
this world.' Do ask Dr. Stokes if that is true."</p>




<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>


<p>After she had been a little longer in town,
Rose saw more clearly the workings of that
ambition which had undermined her cousin's
happiness. She saw where the canker ate and
withered, but she did not know how it could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
eradicated. Something which women understand,
prevented her laying open the secrets
of the house to Edward; and yet she desired
counsel. Possessing much observation as to
the workings of the human heart, she had but
little knowledge as to how those feelings might
be moulded for the best; and she naturally
turned for advice, and with the faith of a Christian
spirit, to the pastor who had instructed her
youth. He had loved them both, and she longed
for his counsel, in the&mdash;alas! vain&mdash;hope
that she, a right-minded but simple girl&mdash;simple
as regards the ambition of life's drama&mdash;might
be able to turn her cousin from the unsatisfied,
unsatisfying longings after place and station.
The difference in their opinions was simply this&mdash;Rose
thought that Helen possessed everything
that Helen could desire, while Helen thought that Helen wanted all things.</p>

<p>It was morning&mdash;not the morning that Rose
had described to her lover, but not more than
seven o'clock&mdash;when Rose, who had been up
late the previous night, was awoke by her cousin's
maid. On entering Helen's dressing-room
she found her already dressed, but so pale and
distressed in her appearance, that she could
hardly recognise the brilliant lawgiver of the
evening's festivities in the pale, languid, feverish
beauty that was seated at her desk.</p>

<p>"Dear Helen, you are weary; ill, perhaps,"
exclaimed her gentle cousin. "You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
entered too soon into gay society, and you suffer
for the public restraint in private."</p>

<p>Her cousin looked steadily in her face, and
then smiled one of those bitter disdainful smiles
which it is always painful to see upon a woman's lip.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Rose," she said; "sit down, and
copy this letter. I have been writing all night,
and yet cannot get a sufficient number finished in time, without your assistance."</p>

<p>Rose did as she was desired, and, to her astonishment,
found that the letters were to the
inhabitants of a borough, which Mr. Ivers had
expressed his desire to represent. Rose wrote
and wrote; but the longest task must have a
termination. About one, the gentleman himself
came into the room, and, as Rose thought,
somewhat indifferently, expressed his surprise,
that what he came to commence, was already
finished. Still he chid his fair wife for an exertion
which he feared might injure her health,
and evinced the strongest desire to succeed in
rescuing the people of L&mdash;&mdash; from the power
of a party to which he was opposed; hinting,
at the same time, that the contest would drain
his purse and many of his resources.</p>

<p>"And let it," exclaimed Helen, when he left
the room, "let it. I care not for <i>that</i>, but I
will overturn every thing that interposes between
me and the desire I have to humble the wife of
the present representative. Look, I would hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
this hand in the fire, ay, and suffer it to smoulder
into ashes, to punish the woman who called
me a proud <i>parvenue</i>! She did so before I
had been a week in London. Her cold calm
face has been a curse to me ever since. She
has stood, the destroying angel, at the gate of
my paradise, poisoning every enjoyment. Let
me but humble <i>her</i>," she continued, rising
proudly from the sofa upon which she had been
resting; "let me but humble <i>her</i>, and I shall
feel a triumphant woman! For that I have
watched and waited; <i>anxiety for that caused
me the loss of my child</i>; but if Ivers succeeds, I shall be repaid."</p>

<p>Rose shuddered. Was it really true, that
having achieved the wealth, the distinction she
panted for, she was still anxious to mount higher?
Was it possible that wealth, station, general
admiration, and the devoted affection of a
tender husband did not satisfy the humbly-born
beauty of an obscure English village? Again
Helen spoke; she told how she had at last succeeded
in rousing her husband to exertion&mdash;how,
with an art worthy a better cause, she had persuaded
him that his country demanded his assistance&mdash;how he had been led almost to believe
that the safety of England was in the hands of
the freeholders of L&mdash;&mdash;; and then she pictured
her own triumph, as the wife of the successful
candidate, over the woman who had called her a <i>parvenue</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
"And, after all," murmured poor Rose, "and
after all, dear Helen, you are really unhappy."</p>

<p>"Miserable!" was the reply&mdash;"no creature
was ever so perfectly miserable as I am! The
one drop of poison has poisoned the whole cup.
What to me was all this grandeur, when I felt
that <i>that</i> woman looked down upon me, and induced
others to do the same; that though I was
with them, I was not of them; and all through
her means. Ivers could not understand my
feeling; and, besides, I dare not let him know
what had been said by one of his own clique,
lest <i>he should become inoculated by the same feeling</i>."</p>

<p>"Another fruit," thought Rose Dillon, "of
the evil which attends unequal marriages."</p>

<p>"But <i>my</i> triumph will come!" she repeated;
"Ivers must carry all before him; and <i>who knows what may follow</i>?"</p>

<p>"Still unsatisfied!" thought Rose, as she
wandered through the splendid rooms and inhaled
the perfume of the most expensive exotics,
and gazed upon beautiful pictures, and listened
to the roll of carriages, and heard the
kind fond voice of Helen's devoted husband
urging the physician, who made his daily calls,
to pay his wife the greatest attention. "Still
unsatisfied!" she repeated; and then she
thought of one of Edward's homely but wise
proverbs&mdash;"All is not gold that glitters;" and
she thought how quite as beautiful, and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
varied by the rich variety of nature, was the
prospect from the parlour-window of the farm-house,
that was to be her own. "And woodbine,
roses, and mignonette breathe as sweet
odours as exotics, and belong of right to the
cottages of England. Ah!" continued the
right-minded girl, "better is a little and content
therewith, than all the riches of wealth and art
without it. If her ambition had even a <i>great</i>
object I could forgive her; but all this for the
littleness of society." This train of thought
led her back to the days of their girlhood, and
she remembered how the same desire to outshine
manifested itself in Helen's childhood.
If Mr. Stokes had been there he could have
told her of the pink gingham, with her grandmother's
injudicious remark thereupon&mdash;"Be
content with the pink gingham <i>now</i>, Helen&mdash;<i>the
time will come when you shall have a better</i>;"
instead of&mdash;"Be always content, Helen, with what befits your sphere of life."</p>

<p>That day was an eventful one to Rose. In
the evening she was seated opposite the window,
observing the lamplighter flying along with his
ladder and his link through the increasing fog,
and wondering why the dinner was delayed so
much beyond the usual hour&mdash;when the little
old cranky gentleman, whose keen and clever
observations had given Rose a very good idea
of his <i>head</i>, and a very bad one of his heart,
stood beside her. In a few brief words he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
explained, that seeing she was different to London
ladies, he had come to the determination of
making her his wife. He did not seem to apprehend any objection on her part to this
arrangement; but having concluded the business
in as few words as possible, stood, with his
hands behind him, very much as if he expected
the lady he addressed to express her gratitude,
and suffer him to name the day. Firmly and
respectfully Rose declined the honour, declaring
"she had no heart to give," and adding a
few civil words of thanks to the old gentleman,
who would have evinced more sense had he proposed
to adopt, not marry her. Without a reply,
the old gentleman left the room; but presently
her cousin entered, and in terms of bitter
scorn, inquired if she were mad enough to
refuse such an offer&mdash;one that would immediately
take her out of her humble sphere, and
place her where she might be happy. Rose
replied, with more than usual firmness, that she
had learned, since she had been with her, the
total insufficiency of rank and power to produce
happiness. "I am convinced," she continued,
"that it is the most likely to dwell where
there are the fewest cares, and that the straining
after distinction is at variance with its existence.
To be useful, and fulfil well the duties
of our native sphere, is the surest way to be
happy. Oh! Helen, you do not know what it
is; you look too much to the future to enjoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
the present; and I have observed it ever since
you threw away the handful of jessamine we
had gathered at the grey fountain of Abbeyweld,
because you could not have moss roses like the squire's daughter."</p>

<p>"Foolish girl!" she answered, "has not perseverance
in the desire obtained the moss roses?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her cousin, sadly, "but now you
desire exotics. I should despise myself if it
were possible that I could forget the affection
of my heart in what appears to me the unsubstantial
vanities of life. Dear Helen, in sickness
or sorrow let me ever be your friend; but
I must be free to keep on in my own humble sphere."</p>

<p>It seemed as if poor Rose was doomed to
undergo all trials. Helen was not one to yield
to circumstances; and though her physician
prescribed rest, she lived almost without it,
avoiding repose, laying herself under the most
painful obligations to obtain her end, and enduring
the greatest mental anxiety. Not only
this; she taunted poor Rose with her increased
anxieties, affirming, that if she had not rendered
the old gentleman her foe by the ill-timed
refusal, he would have assisted, not thwarted,
her cherished object; that his influence was
great, and was now exerted against them. "If,"
she added, "you had only the common tact of
any other girl, you might have played him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
little until the election was over, and then acted as you pleased."</p>

<p>This seemed very shocking to Rose, and she
would have gone to Abbeyweld immediately,
but that she thought it cruel to leave her cousin
while she felt she was useful to her. "Ah,
Rose!" she said, when poor Rose hinted that
in a short time she must return, "how can you
think of it?&mdash;how can you leave me in an <i>enemy's
country</i>? I dare not give even my husband
my entire confidence, for he might fancy
my sensitiveness a low-born feeling. I can
trust you, and none other." Surrounded, according
to the phrase, "with troops of friends,"
and yet able to <i>trust</i> "none other" than the
simple companion of her childhood! "And
yet," murmured the thoughtful Rose, "amongst
so many, the blame cannot be all with the
crowd; Helen herself is as incapable of warm,
disinterested friendship as those of whom she complains."</p>

<p>Rose Dillon's constancy was subjected to a
still greater trial. Amongst the "troops of
friends" who crowded more than ever round
Mr. Ivers while his election was pending, was
a young man as superior to the rest in mind as
in fortune, and Rose Dillon's ready appreciation
of the good and beautiful led her to respect and admire him.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Miss Dillon," he said to her one
morning, after a lagging conversation of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
twenty minutes' duration&mdash;"is it true, Miss
Dillon, that you have discarded altogether the
attentions of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?" and he named the
old gentleman whose offer had been so painful
to Rose, and who was now made painfully
aware that the subject had been publicly talked
of. This confused her. "Nay," he continued,
"I think you ought to be very proud of the
fact, for he is worth two hundred thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"If he were worth ten hundred thousand, it
would make no difference to me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then, you admit the fact."</p>

<p>Rose could not tell a falsehood, though she
confessed her pain that it should be known.
"I intend," she added, "to remain in my own
quiet sphere of life; I am suited for no other."</p>

<p>The gentleman made no direct reply, but
from that hour he observed Rose narrowly.
The day of the election came, with its bribery
and its bustle. Suffice it, that the Honourable
Mr. Ivers was declared duly elected&mdash;that the
splendour of the late member's wife's entertainments
and beauty, were perfectly eclipsed by
the entertainments and beauty of the wife of
the successful candidate&mdash;that every house, <i>except</i>
one, in the town was splendidly illuminated&mdash;and
that the people broke every pane of
glass in the windows of that house, to prove
their attachment to the great principle of freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
of election. "God bless you, cousin!"
said Rose; "God bless you&mdash;your object is
attained. I hope you will sleep well to-night."</p>

<p>"Sleep!" she exclaimed; "how can I sleep?
Did you not hear the wife of a mere city baronet
inquire if late hours did not injure a country
constitution; and see the air with which she said it?"</p>

<p>"And why did you not answer that a country
constitution gave you strength to sustain
them? In the name of all that is right, dearest
Helen, why do you not assert your dignity as a
woman, instead of standing upon your rank?
Why not, as a woman, boldly and bravely revert
to your former position, and at the same
time prove your determination to support your
present? You were as far from shame as Helen
Marsh of Abbeyweld, as you are as the wife of
an honourable member. Be yourself. Be
simply, firmly yourself, my own Helen, and
you will at once, from being the scorned, become the scorner."</p>

<p>"This from you, who love a lowly state?"</p>

<p>"I love my own birthright, lowly though it
be. No one will attempt to pull me down. I
shall have no heartaches&mdash;suffer no affronts?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Helen, "if I had but been born to what I possess."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stokes said if you had been born an
honourable, you would have grasped at a coronet."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>

<p>"And I <i>may</i> have it yet," replied the discontented
beauty, with a weary smile; "I <i>may</i>
have it yet; my husband's brother is still childless.
If I could be but certain that the grave
would receive him a childless man, how proudly
I would take precedence of such a woman as Lady G&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rose looked at her as she spoke. In the
glorious meridian of her beauty&mdash;a creature so
splendid&mdash;of such a fair outside&mdash;with energy,
and grace, and power&mdash;married by a weak ambition&mdash;an
ambition achieved by the accident of
birth&mdash;an ambition having neither honour, nor
virtue, nor patriotism, nor any one laudable aim,
for its object. And she sorrowed in her inmost soul for her cousin Helen.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>


<p>Rose never, of course, made one at the brilliant
assemblies which Mrs. Ivers gave and
graced; she only saw those who breakfasted or
lunched in the square, or who, like the little
old gentleman, and one or two others, joined
the family circle. The excitement of an election,
and the (<i>pro tem.</i>) equality which such an
event creates, brought her more into contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
with her cousin's acquaintances than she had
yet been, and gave the gentleman, who evidently
admired her, an opportunity of studying her
character. There was something strange in a
young woman, situated as was Rose, preserving
so entirely her self-respect, that it encircled
her like a halo; and wherever it is so preserved,
it invariably commands the respect of others.
After the first week or two had passed, Rose
Dillon was perfectly undazzled by the splendour
with which she was surrounded, and was now
engaged in watching for a moment when she
could escape from what she knew was splendid
misery. If Helen had been simply content to
keep her own position&mdash;if she had, as Rose's
wisdom advised, sufficient moral courage to resent
a slight openly, not denying her humble
birth, and yet resolved to be treated as became
her husband's wife&mdash;all would have been happiness
and peace. Proud as Mr. Ivers was of
her, her discontent and perpetual straining after
rank and distinction, watching every body's
every look and movement to discover if it concealed
no <i>covert</i> affront, rendered him, kind
and careful though he was, occasionally dissatisfied;
and she interpreted every manifestation
of his displeasure, however slight, to contempt
for her birth. Rose suffered most acutely, for
she saw how simple was the remedy, and yet
could not prevail on Helen to abate one jot of
her restless ambition. The true spirit of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
Christian woman often moved her to secret
earnest prayer, that God, of His mercy, would
infuse an humbler and holier train of thought
and feeling into Helen's mind; and, above all,
she prayed that it might not come too late.</p>

<p>"You do not think with Mrs. Ivers in all
things, I perceive," said the gentleman I have twice alluded to.</p>

<p>"I am hardly, from my situation," replied
Rose, "privileged to think her thoughts, though perhaps I may think of them."</p>

<p>"A nice distinction," he answered.</p>

<p>"Our lots in life are differently cast. In a
week I return to Abbeyweld; I only came to
be her nurse in illness, and was induced to remain
a little longer because I was useful to
her. They will go to the Continent now, and
I shall return to my native village."</p>

<p>"But," said the gentleman, in a tone of the
deepest interest, "shall you really return without regret?"</p>

<p>"Without regret? Oh yes!"</p>

<p>"Regret nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Suppose," he continued, in a suppressed
tone of deep emotion&mdash;"suppose that a man,
young, rich, and perfectly aware of the value
of your pure and unsullied nature, was to lay his hand and heart"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray, I entreat you, say not another
word," interrupted Rose, breathlessly. "If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
there should be any such, which is hardly possible,
sooner than he should deign to make a
proposal to me, I would tell him that before I
came to visit my cousin, only the very night before,
I became the betrothed of another."</p>

<p>"Of some one, Rose, who took advantage of
your ignorance of the world&mdash;of your want of knowledge of society?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" she replied, covering her face
with her hand; "oh no! he is incapable of
that. He would have suffered me to leave Abbeyweld free of promise, but I would not."</p>

<p>"And do you hold the same faith still Rose?
Think, has not what you have seen, and shared
in, made you ambitious of something beyond a
country life? Your refined mind and genuine
feeling, your taste&mdash;do not, I implore you, deceive yourself."</p>

<p>"I do not, sir; indeed, I do not. Pardon
me; I would not speak disrespectfully of those
above me. Of course, I have not been admitted
into that familiarity which would lead me
to comprehend what at present appears to me
even more disturbed by the littleness of life than
a country village. Conventional forms have,
I fear, little to do with elevation of mind; they
seem to me the result of habit rather than of
thought or feeling. I know this, at least, 'All
is not gold that glitters.' I have seen a tree,
fair to look at in the distance, and covered with
green leaves, but when approached closely, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
trunk was foul and hollowed by impurities, and
when the blast came, it could not stand; even
so with many, fair without and foul within, and
the first adversity, the first great sorrow, over-throws them."</p>

<p>"But this may be the case with the poor as
well as the rich, in the country as well as the town."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, sir. No station can be altogether
free from impurity; but in the country
the incitements to evil seem to me less numerous,
and the temptations fewer by far; the most
dangerous of all, a desire to shine, to climb
above our fellows, less continual. The middle
class is there more healthy and independent."</p>

<p>"And all this owing to the mere circumstance,
think you, of situation?" interrupted the gentleman.</p>

<p>"I am only country bred, sir, as you know,"
replied Rose, earnestly but meekly; "and the
only advantage I have had has been in the society
of one you have heard me mention before
now&mdash;our worthy rector&mdash;and he says it would
make all that is wrong come right, if people
would only fear God and love their neighbour."</p>

<p>"I believe," said the gentleman, "he is
right, quite right; for out of such religion
springs contentment, and all the higher as well
as the humbler virtues. Yes, he is quite right."
Much more he urged Rose, with all the persuasive
eloquence of warm affection, to discover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
if it were possible, she could change. He tried
her on all points, but she replied with the clear
straightforward truthfulness that has nothing to
conceal. She wavered in nothing: firm to her
love, steady to her principles, right-thinking and
clear-sighted, he felt that Rose Dillon of Abbeyweld
would have added the dignity of virtue to
the dignity of rank, but that her mind was of
too high an order to bend to the common influences
that lead women along the beaten track of life.</p>

<p>They parted to meet no more; and Rose
shed tears at their parting. "I did not wish
you to make a declaration that did me too much
honour," she said; "but I entreat you to say
nothing of it to Mrs. Ivers. My own course is
taken, and God knows how earnestly I will
pray that you may find one in every way worthy
your high caste of mind and station."</p>

<p>I wonder would Edward Lynne have quite
approved of those tears; I wonder would he
have been pleased to have observed the cheek
of his affianced bride pressed against the drawing-room
window, to catch a last glimpse of the
cab which dashed from Mr. Ivers' door. Perhaps
not&mdash;for the generous nature of woman's
love and woman's friendship, is often beyond
man's comprehension&mdash;but he would have been
pleased to see, after she had paced the room for
half an hour, the eagerness with which she received
and opened a letter from himself; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
have witnessed the warm kiss impressed upon
his name; to hear the murmured "dear, <i>dear</i>
Edward!" Her heart had never for a moment
failed in its truth&mdash;never for an instant wavered.</p>

<p>That day week the cousins separated. "You
must come to me when I return, Rose," said
Helen&mdash;"you must come and witness my triumphs.
My husband's brother is very ill&mdash;cannot
live long&mdash;but <i>that</i> is a secret. I trust
Ivers will make a figure in the lower, before
called to the upper house; if he does not, it
will break my heart. There, God bless you,
Rose; you have been very affectionate, very
sweet to me, but I do, I confess, envy you that
cheerful countenance&mdash;cheerful and calm. I
always think that contented people want mind
and feeling; but you do not, Rose. By the
way, how strangely Mr. &mdash;&mdash; disappeared; I
thought you had clipped his wings. Well, next
season, perhaps. Of course, after this, you
will think no more of Edward." Fortunately
for Rose, Helen expected no replies, and after
a few more words, as I have said, they parted.</p>

<p>In little more than three months, Rose Dillon and Edward Lynne were married.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>


<p>"It's a decent match enough," said old Mrs.
Myles to the rector when two years had elapsed,
and she had become reconciled to it. "Of course
Rose never could have taken the same stand as
Helen, who has been a lady now more than a
year; though she's a good, grateful girl, and
Edward very attentive&mdash;very attentive indeed&mdash;and
I must say more so than I expected. Helen,
I mean my lady, you know, has, as she
says in her last letter, a great deal to do with
her money&mdash;of course she must have; and
so, sir, pray do not let any one in Abbeyweld
know that the little annuity is not continued&mdash;regularly,
I mean," she added, while a certain
twitching of her features evinced how much she
felt, though she did not at the moment confess
it, the neglect of one she so dearly loved. Like
most talkative people, she frequently talked
away her sorrows; and, thinking she would be
better if she opened her heart, she recommenced,
after wiping away a few natural tears: "You
see, sir, Helen&mdash;I mean her ladyship&mdash;said she
would make it up by-and-bye to me, and so she
ought, poor dear thing; for I sacrificed both
myself and her cousin Rose for her advancement;
and really I cannot tell how the money
goes with those great folk. Only think,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
proceeded the old lady, bringing her face close to
Mr. Stokes, and whispering&mdash;"only think, she
says she never has five pounds she can call her
own. Now, as I told Rose, this is very odd,
because my lord is so very rich since the death
of his brother, ten times as rich as he was at
first, and yet Rose says they are poor now to
what they used to be&mdash;is not that very strange?
She says it is because of the increased expenditure,
and that I don't understand; but it's very
hard, very hard in my old days. If she can't
live upon thirty thousand a-year, I wonder how
she expects her poor old grandmother to live
upon thirty pounds, for that's all my certainty;
and the little farm, I must say, would have gone
to destruction, but for Edward Lynne&mdash;he does
every thing for it, poor fellow. She never sends
me a paper now, with her presentations, and
dresses, and fine parties, printed in it at full-length;
she's ashamed of her birth, that's it;
though sure you and your lady, sir, noticed them
both like equals, and I never even asked to go
near her, though his lordship invited me more
than once&mdash;and he even came to see Rose, as
you know, ay, and a good ten mile out of his
way it was to come&mdash;a good ten mile&mdash;and
kissed her baby, and said he wished he had one
like it, which they say Helen never will have.
Oh, it was a pity that first one of her ladyship
did not live! It is so cruel of her not to let me
see the papers with an account of her fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
doings, all in print&mdash;very cruel&mdash;I who loved her
so, and took care of her&mdash;I never could find
out from Rose whether or no she thought her
happy. Ah, Rose is a good girl! not, however,"
added the old lady, again wiping away her tears&mdash;"not,
however, to be compared to her ladyship;
and I would not say what I have done to
any one in the world but you, sir, who have known them all their lives."</p>

<p>So talked old Mrs. Myles, and so she continued
to talk at intervals, during the next five
years, growing weaker in mind and body, until
at last she took to her bed. "I could die happy,"
said the old woman, "if I were to see Helen
once more; write to her, Rose, and tell her
so; she will not refuse to see me, her first friend&mdash;only once."</p>

<p>Communications between the cousins had
ceased for a long time, but Rose wrote. Mrs.
Myles sent twice every day to the post-office&mdash;and
her hopes, so constantly disappointed, increased
her fever; at the end of a week, a letter came.</p>

<p>"Give it me, Rose, give it me!" exclaimed
Mrs. Myles, "it is from my own darling child,
bless her!&mdash;my beauty! Oh, deary me! I'm
sure that's a beautiful seal, if I could only see
it; prop me up&mdash;there. How the jessamine
blinds the window&mdash;now my spectacles&mdash;so"&mdash;She
tried hard to read, but the power of sight
was gone. "She used to write the best hand in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
the school, but this fashionable writing is hard
to make out," observed the old woman; "so do you read it, Rosy."</p>

<p>"Here is ten pounds to begin with," said
Rose, placing the gossamer note before her.&mdash;Mrs.
Myles mechanically took up the money,
and played with it as a child plays with a toy,
and Rose read the few words that accompanied
the gift:&mdash;"Grieved to the heart to hear of the
illness of her ever dear relative&mdash;would be miserable
about her but from the knowledge of
Rose being the best nurse in the world&mdash;begs
she will let her know how the dear invalid is
by return of post, and also if there is any thing
she could send to alleviate her sufferings."</p>

<p>While Rose was reading the letter, Mrs.
Myles's long thin feeble fingers were playing
with the note, her dim eyes fixed upon the window;
large round tears coursed each other
down her colourless cheeks. "No word about
coming, Rose&mdash;no word about coming," she
muttered, after a pause; "send her back this
trash," she added, bitterly&mdash;"send her back this
trash, and tell her the last tears I shed were shed
not for my sins, but for her cruelty." She continued
to mutter much that they could not understand;
but evening closed in, and Rose told
Edward that she slept at last; she did certainly,
and Rose soon discovered that it was her
last sleep. The money was returned; and
again five years elapsed without Rose hearing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
directly or indirectly, from her rich and titled
cousin. In the mean time, Edward and Rose
prospered exceedingly; three handsome, happy
children blessed their home. Their industry
perfected whatever Providence bestowed; nothing
was wasted, nothing neglected; the best
farmers in the neighbourhood asked advice of
Edward Lynne; and the "born ladies," as
poor Mrs. Myles would have called them, would
have forgotten that Rose was only a farmer's
wife, if wise Rose had been herself disposed to
forget it. But great as their worldly prosperity
had been, it was nothing to the growth and continuance
of that holy affection which cheered
and hallowed their happy dwelling&mdash;the chief
characteristic of which was a freedom from pretension
of all kinds. Rose suffered appearances
to grow with their means, but never to precede
them; and though this is not the world's
practice, the duty is not on that account the less
imperative. They were seated one evening
round their table, Edward reading, while his
wife worked, when the master of the post-office brought them a letter.</p>

<p>"It has lain two days, Measter Lynne," said
the man, "for you never send but once a-week;
only, as I thought by the seal it must be something
grand, whoy I brought it down myself."</p>

<p>It was from Helen!&mdash;from the ambitious
cousin&mdash;a few sad, mournful lines, every one
of which seemed dictated by a breaking heart.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>

<p>She was ill and wretched, and the physician had
suggested change of air; but above all her native
air. Would Rose receive her for a little
time, just to try what its effect might be?&mdash;she
was sure she would, and she would be with her immediately.</p>

<p>"Strange," said Edward, "how nature will
assert and keep its power; when luxury, art,
skill, knowledge, fail to restore health, they tell
you of native air, trusting to the simple, pure
restorative, which is the peasant's birthright, as
infallible. I wonder, Rose, how those fine people
like to be thrown back upon the nature they so outrage."</p>

<p>"Poor Helen!" exclaimed Rose, "how
dispirited she seems&mdash;how melancholy! I
ought to feel afraid of your meeting her, I suppose,
Edward; but I do not&mdash;you have grown
satisfied with your poor Rose. We shall be
able to make her very comfortable, shall we
not?"&mdash;and then she smiled at the homeliness
of the phrase, and wondered what Helen would say if she heard her.</p>

<p>It was not without sundry heartbeatings that
Rose heard the carriage stop, and assisted Helen
to alight; nor could she conceal her astonishment
at the ravages which not past years but
past emotions had wrought on her once beautiful face.</p>

<p>The habit of suppressing thoughts, feelings,
and emotions, had altogether destroyed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
frank expression of her exquisitely chiselled
mouth, which, when it smiled now, smiled alone;
for the eyes, so finely formed, so exquisitely
fringed, did not smile in unison; they had acquired
a piercing and searching expression, altogether
different from their former brilliancy.</p>

<p>The elevated manners, the polished tone
which high society alone bestows, only increased
the distance between the two cousins, though
Rose was certainly gratified by the exclamation
of pleasure which told how much better than
she anticipated were the accommodations prepared by her humble relative.</p>

<p>"Such pretty rooms&mdash;such beautiful flowers!
Rose, you must have grown rich, and without
growing unhappy. Strange, you look ten years younger than I do!"</p>

<p>"Late hours, public life, and anxieties," said Rose.</p>

<p>"Yes, that last appointment his lordship obtained,
the very thing above all others I so desired
for him, has completely divided him from
his home. We hardly ever meet now, except
at what I may call our own public dinners."</p>

<p>"And he, who used to be so affectionate, so
fond of domestic life!" involuntarily exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>"And is so still; but the usages of society, the
intrigues and bustle of public business, quite
overthrow every thing of that kind. Oh, it is a weary, wearying world!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>

<p>"But to a mind like yours, the achieving an object must be so delightful!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Rose, so it is; but that sort of thing
soon passes away, and we have no sooner obtained
possession of one, than another still more
desirable presents itself. How peaceful and
happy you seem. Well, an idle mind must be a perpetual feast."</p>

<p>"But I have not an idle mind, not an idle
moment," replied Rose, colouring a little; "my
husband, my children, my humble household,
the care of the parochial schools, now that poor
Mr. Stokes has grown so infirm"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" interrupted Helen; "and yet,
Rose, when I look at you, even now, I cannot
but think you were fitted for better things."</p>

<p>"Better than learning how to occupy time
profitably, and training souls for immortality!"
she replied; "but you are worn and tired, let
me wait upon you this one night, as I used long,
long ago to do&mdash;let me wait upon my own dear
cousin, instead of a menial, this one night, and
to-morrow you shall see Edward and the children."</p>

<p>The worn-hearted woman of the great world
laid her face upon her cousin's shoulder, and
then fairly hid it in her bosom. Why it was,
He only, who knows the mysterious workings
of the human heart, can tell; but she wept long
and very bitterly, assigning no cause for her
tears, but sobbing and weeping like a sorrowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
child, while the arms she had flung round her
cousin's neck prevented Rose from moving.
Their tears once more mingled, as they had often
done in childhood&mdash;once more&mdash;but not for long.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone for a little, and I will ring
for my maid," she said at last; "I am too artificial
to be waited upon by you, Rose. It was
otherwise when you used to twine gay poppies
and bright flowers in my hair, telling me, at the
same time, how much wiser it would have been
to have chosen the less fading and more fragrant ones."</p>

<p>"Her husband&mdash;and her children!" thought
Helen; "if she had neither children nor husband,
she would have been of such value to me
now; noisy children, I dare say, troublesome
and wearying. Native air! native air, indeed,
<i>ought</i> to work wonders." It would be hardly
credited that Helen&mdash;the beauty&mdash;the admired&mdash;the
woman of rank&mdash;bestowed quite as much
trouble upon her morning toilette as if she had
been in London. Such was her aching passion
for universal sway, that she could not bear to
be thought faded by her old lover, though he
was only a farmer; and this trouble was taken
despite bodily pain that would have worn a strong man to a skeleton.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say whether Helen
was pleased or displeased at finding Edward
Lynne what might, without any flattery, be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
termed a country gentleman, betraying no emotion
whatever at the sight of one who had
caused him so much suffering, and only anxious
to gratify her because she was his wife's relative.
She thought, and she was right, that she
discovered pity, and not admiration, as he looked upon her.</p>

<p>"You think me changed," she said.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship has been ill and harassed."</p>

<p>"Ah! we all change except Rose."</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the country bred husband,
"she, indeed, is an exception; she could not even change for the better."</p>

<p>And then the children, two such glorious
boys, fine, manly fellows. "And what will you
be?" inquired her ladyship of the eldest.</p>

<p>"A farmer, my lady."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"A merchant, I hope."</p>

<p>"Your boys are as unambitious as yourself, Rose."</p>

<p>"I fear not," she answered; "this fellow
wants to get into the middle class; but Mr.
Stokes says the prosperity of a country depends
more upon the middle class than upon either the high or the low."</p>

<p>To this Helen made no reply, for her attention
was occupied by the loveliness of Rose's
little girl. The child inherited, in its perfection,
the beauty of her family, and a grace and
spirit peculiarly her own. Rose could not find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
it in her heart to deprive her cousin of the child's
society, which seemed to interest and amuse her,
and the little creature performed so many acts
of affection and attention from the impulse of
her own kind nature, that Helen, unaccustomed
to that sort of devotion, found her twine around
her sympathies in a novel and extraordinary
manner; it was a new sensation, and she could
not account for its influence. After a week had
passed, she was able to walk out, and met by
chance the old clergyman. He kissed the child,
and passed on with a bow, which, perhaps, had
more of bitterness in its civility than, strictly
speaking, befitted a Christian clergyman; but
he thought of the neglect she had evinced towards
old Mrs. Myles, and if he had spoken, it
would have been to vent his displeasure, and
reprove the woman whose rank could not shield
her from his scorn. She proceeded towards
the churchyard. "Look, lady!" said little
Rose; "father put that stone over that grave to
please mother. The relation who is buried
there took care of my mother when she was a
<i>littler</i> girl than I am now, and he told me to
strew flowers over the grave, which we do. See,
I can read it&mdash;'Sacred to the Memory of Mrs.
Margaret Myles, who died the seventeenth of
June, eighteen hundred'&mdash;and something&mdash;I
can hardly read figures yet, lady. 'This stone
was placed here by her grateful relatives, E. and
R.S.,' meaning Rose and Edward Lynne."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>

<p>The coldness of the clergyman was forgotten
in the bitterness of self-reproach. "I was
a fool," she thought, as she turned away, "to
fancy that my native air could be untainted by
the destiny which has mocked me from my cradle."</p>

<p>"Ah! lady dear," exclaimed a crone, rising
from a grave where she had been sitting, "don't
you remember old Betty? They all said in the
village you'd be too proud to look on your
grandmother's grave; but you're not, I see.
Well, that's good&mdash;that's good. We had a funeral
last week, and the vault of the old earl
was broken in. The stupid sexton stuck his
pick in amongst the old bricks, and so the great
man's skull came tumbling out, and rolled beside
the skull of Job Martin, the old cobbler;
and the sexton laid them both on the edge of
the grave, the earl's skull and the cobbler's
skull, until he should fetch a mason to mend the
vault, and&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;when the mason
came, the sexton could not tell which was the
earl's skull and which was the cobbler's! Lady,
you must understand how this is&mdash;it's all
the same in a hundred years, according to the
saying; and so it is. None of them could tell
which was the earl's, and which the cobbler's.
My skull may lie next a lady's yet, and no one tell the difference."</p>

<p>The lady and child hastened from the churchyard,
and the old woman muttered, "To see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
that! She's not half as well to look at now as
the farmer's wife. Ah! 'All is not gold that
glitters!'" How happy it is for those who believe
in the truth of this proverb, and from it learn to be content!</p>

<p>It might be a week after this occurrence that
Helen sent for Rose. The lady either was, or
fancied herself better, and said so, adding, it
was in her (Rose's) power to make her happier
than she had ever been. Reverting to the period
when her cousin visited her in London, she
alluded to what she had suffered in becoming a
mother, and yet having her hopes destroyed by
the anxiety and impetuosity of her own nature.
"At first," she said, "the trouble was anything
but deep-rooted, for I fancied God would send
many more, but it was not so; and now the
title I so desired must go to the child of a woman&mdash;Oh,
Rose, how I <i>do</i> hate her!&mdash;a woman
who publicly thanks God that no plebeian blood
will disgrace <i>my</i> husband's title and <i>her</i> family.
I would peril my soul to cause her the pain she has caused me."</p>

<p>"You do so now," said Rose, gently but
solemnly. "Oh! think that this violence and
revenge sins your own soul, and is every way unworthy of you."</p>

<p>Helen did not heed the interruption. "To
add to my agony," she continued, "my husband
cherishes her son as if it were his own; the boy
stands even now between his affections and me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
He has reproached me for what he terms my
insensibility to his perfections, and says I ought
to rejoice that he is so easily rendered happy&mdash;only
imagine this! Rose, you must give me
your daughter, to be to me as my own. Her
beauty and sweetness will at once wean my husband's
love from this boy; and, moreover, children
brought up together&mdash;do you not see?&mdash;that
boy will become attached to one of the
'plebeian blood,' and wedding <i>her</i> hereafter,
scald to the core the proud heart of his mother, as she has scalded mine!"</p>

<p>"I cannot, Helen," replied Rose, after a
pause, during which her cousin's glittering inquiring
eyes were fixed upon her face&mdash;"I cannot;
I could not answer to my God at the last
day for delivering the soul he gave to my care
to be so tutored (forgive me) as to forget Him in all things."</p>

<p>"Forget God!" repeated Helen once or
twice&mdash;"I forget God! Do you think I am a heathen?"</p>

<p>"No, cousin&mdash;no&mdash;for you have all knowledge
of the truth; but knowledge, and profiting
by our knowledge, are different. My little
gentle-hearted girl will be happier far in her
own sphere. I could not see her degraded to
bait a trap for any purpose; she will be happy, happier in her own sphere."</p>

<p>The lady bit her compressed lips; but during
her whole life she never gave up a point, nor an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
object, proving how necessary it is that the
strong mind should be well and highly directed.
Small feeble minds pass through the world doing
little good and little harm, but to train a large
mind is worth the difficulty&mdash;worth the trouble
it occasions: its possession is either a great
blessing or a great curse. To Helen it was the
latter, and curses never fall singly. "You have
boys to provide for," she said, "and if I adopted
that child, I would not suffer their station to disgrace their sister."</p>

<p>"I am sure you mean us kindly and generously;
nor am I blind to the advantages of
such an offer for my boys. Their father has
prospered greatly, and could at this moment
place them in any profession they chose&mdash;still
influence would help them forward; but the advancement
of one child must not be purchased
by"&mdash;Rose paused for a word&mdash;she did not
wish to hurt her cousin's feelings&mdash;and yet none
suggested itself but what she conceived to be
the true one, and she repeated, lowly and gently,
her opinion, prefacing it with, "You will forgive
in this matter my plain speaking, but the
advancement of one child must not be purchased by the sacrifice of another."</p>

<p>"Your prejudices have bewildered your understanding," exclaimed the lady. "Whatever
my ambition may be, my morality is unimpeached;
a vestal would lose none of her purity beneath my roof."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

<p>"Granted, fully and truly; woman's first virtue
is untainted, but that is not her only one;
forgive me. I have no right to judge or dictate,
nor to give an unasked opinion; I am
grateful for your kindness; but my child, given
to me as a blessing for time and a treasure for
eternity, must remain beneath my roof until her mind and character are formed."</p>

<p>"You are mad, Rose; consider her future happiness"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen! are you more happy than your humble cousin?"</p>

<p>"She would be brought up in the sphere I
was thrust into, and have none of the contentions I have had to endure," said Helen.</p>

<p>"A sphere full of whirlpools and quicksands,"
replied the mother. "The fancy you have
taken to her might pass away. She might be
taught the bitterness of eating a dependant's
bread, and the soft and luxurious habits of her
early days would unfit her for bearing so heavy
a burden; it would be in vain then to recall her
to her humble home; she would have lost all
relish for it. It might please God to take you
after a few years, and my poor child would be
returned to what she would then consider poverty. Urge me no more, I entreat you."</p>

<p>Helen's face grew red and pale by turns.
"You mock at and mar my purposes," she
said. "My husband was struck by the beauty
of that child, and I longed to see her; but I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
doomed to disappointment. I never tried to
grasp a substance that it did not fade into a
shadow! What am I now?" Her eyes rested
upon the reflection, given by the glass, of the
two cousins. "Look! that tells the story&mdash;worn
in heart and spirit, blighted and bitter.
You, Rose&mdash;even you, my own flesh and blood&mdash;will
not yield to me&mdash;the only creature, perhaps,
that could love me! Oh! the void, the
desert of life, without affection!&mdash;a childless
mother&mdash;made so by"&mdash;She burst into tears,
and Rose was deeply affected. She felt far
more inclined to yield her child to the desolate
heart of Helen Marsh, than to the proud array
of Lady &mdash;&mdash;; but she also knew her duty.</p>

<p>"Will you grant me this favour," said Helen
at last; "will you let the child decide"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would not yield to the child's decision,
but you may, if you please, prove her," answered her mother.</p>

<p>The little girl came softly into the room, having
already learned that a bounding step was not meet for "my lady's chamber."</p>

<p>"Rosa, listen; will you come with me to
London, to ride in a fine coach drawn by four
horses&mdash;to wear a velvet frock&mdash;see beautiful
sights, and become a great lady. Will you,
dear Rosa, and be my own little girl?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the child, gleefully;
"that I will; <i>that</i> would be so nice&mdash;a coach
and four&mdash;a velvet frock&mdash;a great lady&mdash;oh!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
dear me!" The mother felt her limbs tremble,
her heart sink. "Oh! my own dear mother,
will not <i>that</i> be nice? and the beautiful sights
you have told me of&mdash;St. Paul's and Westminster&mdash;oh! mother, we shall be so happy!"</p>

<p>"Not <i>me</i>, Rosa," answered Mrs. Lynne, with
as firm a voice as she could command. "Now,
listen to me: you might ride <i>in</i> a coach and
four, instead of <i>on</i> your little pony&mdash;wear velvet
instead of cotton&mdash;see St. Paul's and Westminster&mdash;but
have no more races on the downs,
no more peeping into birds' nests, no more seeing
the old church, or hearing its Sabbath bells.
You <i>may</i> become a great lady, but you must
leave and forget your father and me."</p>

<p>"Leave you, and my father and brothers!
You did not mean <i>that</i> surely&mdash;you could not
mean that, my lady&mdash;could they not go with me?"</p>

<p>"That would be impossible!"</p>

<p>"Then I will stay here," said the little girl
firmly; "I love them better than every thing
else in the world. Thank you, dear lady, but I cannot leave them."</p>

<p>"Leave <i>us</i>, then, Rosa," said Helen, proudly.
The child obeyed with a frightened look, wondering how she had displeased the "grand
lady."</p>

<p>If Helen had been steeped to the very lips in
misery, she could not have upbraided the world
more bitterly than she did, giving vent to long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
pent-up feelings, and reproaching Rose, not
only for her folly in not complying with her
wish, but for her happiness and contentment,
which, while she envied, she affected to despise.</p>

<p>"You cannot make me believe that the high-born
and wealthy are what you represent," said
her cousin. "A class must not be condemned
because of an individual; and though I never
felt inclined to achieve rank, I honour many of
its possessors. It is the unsatisfied longing of
your own heart that has made you miserable,
dear Helen; and oh! let me entreat you, by
the remembrance of our early years, to suffer
yourself to enjoy what you possess."</p>

<p>"What I possess!" she repeated; "the
dread and dislike of my husband's relatives&mdash;the
reputation of 'she <i>was</i> very handsome'&mdash;a
broken constitution&mdash;nothing to lean upon or love&mdash;a worn and weary heart!"</p>

<p>"You have a mine of happiness in your husband's affection."</p>

<p>"Not now," she answered bitterly; "not now&mdash;not now." And she was right.</p>

<p>The next day she left the farm, where peace
and prosperity dwelt together; despite herself,
it pained her to witness such happiness. It is
possible that the practical and practised theories
she had witnessed might have changed her, had
she not foolishly thought it too late. Her disappointment
had been great; from the adoption
of that child she had expected much of what,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
after all, is the creating and existing principle
of woman's nature&mdash;natural affection; but this
was refused by its mother's wisdom. Her
worldly prospects had been doomed to disappointment,
because she hungered and thirsted
after vanities and distinctions, which never can
afford sustenance to an immortal spirit; and
even when she desired to cultivate attachment,
it did not proceed from the pure love of woman&mdash;the
natural stream was corrupted by an unworthy motive.</p>

<p>Again years rolled on. In the records of
fashionable life, the movements and fetes of
Lady &mdash;&mdash; continued to be occasionally noted
as the most brilliant of the season; then rumours
became rife that Lord and Lady &mdash;&mdash;
did not live as affectionately as heretofore;
then, after twenty years of union, separation
ensued upon the public ground of "incompatibility
of temper"&mdash;his friends expressing their
astonishment how his lordship could have so
long endured the pride and caprice of one so
lowly born, while hers&mdash;but friends! she had
no friends!&mdash;a few partizans of the "rights of
women" there were, who, for the sake of "the
cause," defended the woman. She had been
all her life too restless for friendship, and when
the sensation caused by her separation from her
husband had passed away, none of the gay
world seemed to remember her existence. Rose
and her husband lived, loved, and laboured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
together. It was astonishing how much good
they did, and how much they were beloved by
their neighbours. Their names had never been
noted in any fashionable register, but it was engraved
upon every peasant heart in the district.
"As happy as Edward and Rose Lynne," became
a proverb; and if any thing was needed
to increase the love the one felt for the other, it
was perfected by the affection of their children.</p>

<p>"I think," said the old rector, as they sat
round the evening tea-table, "that our school
may now vie with any in the diocese&mdash;thanks
to the two Roses; twin roses they might almost
be called, though Rosa hardly equals Rose. I
wonder what Mrs. Myles would say if she were
to look upon this happy group. Ah dear!&mdash;well
God is very good to permit such a foretaste
of heaven as is met with here." And the benevolent
countenance of the good pastor beamed
upon the happy family. "I have brought
you the weekly paper," he continued; "the
Saturday paper. I had not time to look at it
myself, but here it is. Now, Edward, read us
the news." The farther people are removed
from the busy scenes of life, the more anxious
they are to hear of their proceedings; and Edward
read leading articles, debates, reviews, until,
under the head of "Paris," he read as follows&mdash;"Considerable
sensation has been excited
here by the sudden death of the beautiful Lady &mdash;&mdash;."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>

<p>Rose screamed, and the paper trembled in
Edward's hand. "This is too horrid," he said.</p>

<p>"Do let me hear it all!" exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>It was many minutes before Edward Lynne
could tell her, that there was more than an insinuation,
that, wearied of existence, she, the
brilliant, the beautiful, the <i>fortunate</i> Lady &mdash;&mdash;,
wearied of life, had abridged it herself.</p>

<p>Before they separated that evening, the Holy
Word was read with more than usual feeling
and solemnity by Mr. Stokes, and yet he could
not read as much as usual. "All flesh is
grass," brought tears into his eyes. His prayer
that all might long enjoy the perpetual feast of
a contented mind, was echoed by every heart;
and the gratitude all felt for God's goodness to
them was mingled with regret for Helen; all intermediate
time was forgotten, and the elders
of that little party only remembered the bright
and beautiful girl, the pride of Abbeyweld.</p>

<p>"God bless my beloved pupil!" said the
venerable clergyman, as he departed; "without
a holy grace all is indeed vanity. May
Rosa learn, as early as her mother did, that</p>

<center>'ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS.'"</center>

<h2>THERE IS NO HURRY.</h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p>I do not tell you whether the village of Repton,
where the two brothers, John and Charles
Adams, originally resided, is near or far from
London: it is a pretty village to this day; and
when John Adams, some five-and-thirty years
ago, stood on the top of Repton Hill and looked
down upon the houses&mdash;the little church,
whose simple gate was flanked by two noble
yew trees, beneath whose branches he had often
sat&mdash;the murmuring river in which he had often
fished&mdash;the cherry orchards, where the ripe fruit
hung like balls of coral; when he looked down
upon all these dear domestic sights&mdash;for so every
native of Repton considered them&mdash;John Adams
might have been supposed to question if he had
acted wisely in selling to his brother Charles
the share of the well-cultivated farm, which had
been equally divided at their father's death. It
extended to the left of the spot on which he was
standing, almost within a ring fence; the meadows,
fresh shorn of their produce, and fragrant
with the perfume of new hay&mdash;the crops full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
promise, and the lazy cattle laving themselves
in the standing pond of the abundant farmyard;
in a paddock, set apart for his especial
use, was the old blind horse his father had bestrode
during the last fifteen years of his life;
it leant its sightless head upon the gate, half up-turned,
he fancied, to where he stood. It is
wonderful what small things will sometimes stir
up the hearts of strong men, ay, and what is
still more difficult, even of ambitious men. Yet
he did not feel at that moment a regret for the
fair acres he had parted with; he was full of
the importance which the possession of a considerable sum of money gives a young man,
who has been fagging almost unsuccessfully in
an arduous profession, and one which requires
a certain appearance of success to command
success&mdash;for John Adams even then placed
M.D. after his plain name; yet still, despite
the absence of sorrow, and the consciousness
of increased power, he continued to look at
poor old Ball until his eyes swam in tears.</p>

<p>With the presence of his father, which the
sight of the old horse had conjured up, came
the remembrance of his peculiarities, his habits,
his expressions; and he wondered, as they passed
in review before him, how he could ever have
thought the dear old man testy or tedious; even
his frequent quotations from "Poor Richard"
appeared to him, for the first time, the results
of common prudence; and his rude but wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
rhyme, when, in the joy of his heart, he told his
father he had absolutely received five guineas as
one fee from an ancient dame who had three
middle-aged daughters (he had not, however,
acquainted his father with <i>that</i> fact,) came more
forcibly to his memory than it had ever done to his ear&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"For want and age save while you may,</p>
<p>No morning sun shines all the day."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>He repeated the last line over and over again,
as his father had done; but as his "morning
sun" was at that moment shining, it is not matter
of astonishment that the remembrance was
evanescent, and that it did not make the impression
upon him his father had desired <i>long</i> before.</p>

<p>A young, unmarried, handsome physician,
with about three thousand pounds in his pocket,
and "good expectations," might be excused for
building "des chateaux en Espagne." A very
wise old lady said once to me&mdash;"Those who
have none on earth may be forgiven for building
them in the air; but those who have them
on earth should be content therewith." Not
so, however, was John Adams; he built and
built, and then by degrees descended to the realities
of his position. What power would not
that three thousand pounds give him! He wondered
if Dr. Lee would turn his back upon him
now when they met in consultation; and Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
Chubb, the county apothecary, would he laugh
and ask him if he could read his own prescriptions?
Then he recurred to a dream&mdash;for it
was so vague at that time as to be little more&mdash;whether
it would not be better to abandon altogether
country practice, and establish himself in
the metropolis&mdash;London. A thousand pounds,
advantageously spent, with a few introductions,
would do a great deal in London, and that was
not a third of what he had. And this great idea
banished all remembrance of the past, all sense
of the present&mdash;the young aspirant thought only of the future.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p>Five years have passed. Dr. John Adams
was "settled" in a small "showy" house in the
vicinity of Mayfair; he had, the world said,
made an excellent match. He married a very
pretty girl, "highly connected," and was considered
to be possessed of personal property,
because, for so young a physician, Dr. Adams
lived in "a superior style." His brother Charles
was still residing in the old farm-house, to which,
beyond the mere keeping it in repair, he had
done but little, except, indeed, adding a wife to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
his establishment&mdash;a very gentle, loving, yet industrious
girl, whose dower was too small to
have been her only attraction. Thus both brothers
might be said to be fairly launched in life.</p>

<p>It might be imagined that Charles Adams,
having determined to reside in his native village,
and remain, what his father and grandfather had
been, a simple gentleman farmer, and that rather
on a small than a large scale, was altogether
without that feeling of ambition which stimulates
exertion and elevates the mind. Charles
Adams had quite enough of this&mdash;which may be
said, like fire, to be "a good servant, but a bad
master"&mdash;but he made it subservient to the dictates
of prudence&mdash;and a forethought, the gift,
perhaps, that, above all others, we should most
earnestly covet for those whose prosperity we
would secure. To save his brother's portion of
the freehold from going into the hands of strangers,
he incurred a debt; and wisely&mdash;while he
gave to his land all that was necessary to make
it yield its increase&mdash;he abridged all other expenses,
and was ably seconded in this by his
wife, who <i>resolved</i>, until principal and interest
were discharged, to live quietly and carefully.
Charles contended that every appearance made
beyond a man's means was an attempted fraud
upon the public; while John shook his head,
and answered that it might do very well for
Charles to say so, as no one expected the sack
that brought the grain to market to be of fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
Holland, but that no man in a profession could
get on in London without making "an appearance."
At this Charles shrugged his shoulders,
and thanked God he lived at Repton.</p>

<p>The brothers, as years moved rapidly on&mdash;engaged
as they were by their mutual industry
and success in their several fields of action&mdash;met
but seldom. It was impossible to say which
of the two continued the most prosperous. Dr.
Adams made several lucky hits; and having so
obtained a position, was fortunate in having an
abundance of patients in an intermediate sort
of state&mdash;that is, neither very well nor very ill.
Of a really bland and courteous nature, he was
kind and attentive to all, and it was certain that
such of his patients as were only in moderate
circumstances, got well long before those who
were rich; his friends attributed this to his humanity
as much as to his skill; his enemies
said he did not like "poor patients." Perhaps
there was a mingling of truth in both statements.
The money he had received for his portion of
the land was spent, certainly, before his receipts
equalled his expenditure; and strangely enough,
by the time the farmer had paid off his debt, the
doctor was involved, not to a large amount, but
enough to render his "appearance" to a certain
degree fictitious. This embarrassment, to
do him justice, was not of long continuance;
he became the fashion; and before prosperity
had turned his head by an influx of wealth, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
as to render him careless, he got rid of his debt,
and then his wife agreed with him "that they might live as they pleased."</p>

<p>It so happened that Charles Adams was present
when this observation was made, and it
spoke well for both the brothers that their different
positions in society had not in the smallest
degree cooled their boyhood's affection; not
even the money transactions of former times,
which so frequently create disunion, had changed
them; they met less frequently, but they
always met with pleasure, and separated with regret.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the doctor triumphantly,
as he glanced around his splendid rooms,
and threw himself into a <i>chaise longue</i>&mdash;then a
new luxury&mdash;"well, it is certainly a charming
feeling to be entirely out of debt."</p>

<p>"And yet," said his wife, "it would not be wise to confess it in our circle."</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired Charles.</p>

<p>"Because it would prove that we had been in it," answered the lady.</p>

<p>"At all events," said John, "now I shall not
have to reproach myself with every extra expense,
and think I ought to pay my debts first;
now I may live exactly as I please."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said Charles.</p>

<p>"Not think so!" repeated Mrs. Adams in a tone of astonishment.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>

<p>"Not think so!" exclaimed John; "do I not make the money myself?"</p>

<p>"Granted, my dear fellow; to be sure you do," said Charles.</p>

<p>"Then why should I not spend it as pleases
me best? Is there any reason why I should not?"</p>

<p>As if to give the strongest dramatic effect to
Charles's opinion, the nurse at that moment
opened the drawing-room door, and four little
laughing children rushed into the room.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;are four reasons against your spending
your income exactly as you please; unless,
indeed, part of your plan be to provide for
them," answered Charles very seriously.</p>

<p>"I am sure," observed Mrs. Adams, with the
half-offended air of a weak woman when she
hears the truth, "John need not be told his duty
to his children; he has always been a most affectionate father."</p>

<p>"A father may be fond and foolish," said
Charles, who was peculiarly English in his
mode of giving an opinion. "For my part, I
could not kiss my little Mary and Anne when
I go to bed at night, if I did not feel I had already
formed an accumulating fund for their
future support&mdash;a support they will need all the
more when their parents are taken from them,
as they must be, in the course of time."</p>

<p>"They must marry," said Mrs. Adams.</p>

<p>"That is a chance," replied Charles; "women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
hang on hands now-a-days. At all events,
by God's blessing, I am resolved that, if they
are beauties, they shall never be forced by poverty
to accept unworthy matches; if they are
plain, they shall have enough to live upon without husbands."</p>

<p>"That is easy enough for you, Charles," said
the doctor, "who have had your broad acres to
support you, and no necessity for expenditure
or show of any kind; who might go from Monday
morning till Saturday night in home-spun,
and never give any thing beyond home-brewed
and gooseberry wine, with a chance bottle of
port to your visiters&mdash;while I, Heaven help me!
was obliged to dash in a well-appointed equipage,
entertain, and appear to be doing a great
deal in my profession, when a guinea would
pine in solitude for a week together in my pocket."</p>

<p>"I do not want to talk with you of the past,
John," said Charles; "our ideas are more likely
to agree now than they were ten or twelve years
ago; I will speak of the future and present.
You are now out of debt, in the very prime of
life, and in the receipt of a splendid income;
but do not, let me entreat you, spend it as it
comes; lay by something for those children;
provide for them either by insurance, or some
of the many means that are open to us all. Do
not, my dear brother, be betrayed by health, or
the temptation for display, to live up to an income
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
the nature of which is so essentially precarious."</p>

<p>"Really," murmured Mrs. Adams, "you put one into very low spirits."</p>

<p>Charles remained silent, waiting his brother's reply.</p>

<p>"My dear Charles," he said at last, "there
is a great deal of truth in what you say&mdash;certainly
a great deal; but I cannot change my
style of living, strange as it may seem. If I
did, I should lose my practice. And then I
must educate my children; <i>that</i> is an imperative duty, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it is; it is a <i>part</i> of the provision
I have spoken of, but not the whole&mdash;a portion
only. If you have the means to do both, it is
your duty to do both; and you <i>have</i> the means.
Nay, my dear sister, do not seem angry or annoyed
with me; it is for the sake of your children
I speak; it is to prevent their ever knowing
practically what we do know theoretically&mdash;that
the world is a hard world; hard and unfeeling
to those who need its aid. It is to prevent
the possibility of their feeling <i>a reverse</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams burst into tears, and walked out
of the room. Charles was convinced that <i>she</i> would not uphold his opinion.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said John, "I intend to provide
for my children; but <i>there is no hurry</i>, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"There should be no hesitation in the case,"
interrupted Charles; "every man <i>intends</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
provide for his children. God forbid that I
should imagine any man to be sufficiently wicked
to say&mdash;I have been the means of bringing
this child into existence&mdash;I have brought it up
in the indulgence of all the luxuries with which
I indulged myself; and now I intend to withdraw
them all from it, and leave it to fight its
own way through the world. No man could
look on the face of the innocent child nestling
in your bosom and say <i>that</i>; but if you do not
appropriate a portion of the means you possess
to save that child from the 'hereafter,' you act
as if you had resolved so to cast it on the wild waters of a turbulent world."</p>

<p>"But, Charles, I intend to do all that you
counsel; no wonder poor Lucy could not bear
these words, when I, your own and only brother,
find them stern and reproachful; no wonder
that such should be the case; of course I
<i>intend</i> to provide for my children."</p>

<p>"Then DO IT," said Charles.</p>

<p>"Why, so I will; but cannot in a moment.
I have already said there is no hurry. You must give a little time."</p>

<p>"The time may come, my dear John, when
TIME will give you no time. You have been
spending over and above your debt&mdash;more than,
as the father of four children, you have any
right to spend. The duty parents owe their
children in this respect has preyed more strongly
on my mind than usual, as I have been called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
on lately to witness its effects&mdash;to see its
misery. One family at Repton, a family of
eight children, has been left entirely without
provision, by a man who enjoyed a situation of
five hundred a-year in quarterly payments."</p>

<p>"That man is, however, guiltless. What
could he save out of five hundred a-year? How
could he live on less?" replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"Live upon four, and insure his life for the
benefit of those children. Nay," continued
Charles, in the vehemence of his feelings, "the
man who does not provide means of existence
for his helpless children, until they are able to
provide for themselves, cannot be called a reasonable
person; and the legislature ought to
oblige such to contribute to a fund to prevent
the spread of the worst sort of pauperism&mdash;that
which comes upon well-born children from the
carelessness or selfishness of their parents. God
in his wisdom, and certainly in his mercy, removed
the poor broken-hearted widow of the
person I alluded to a month after his death;
and the infant, whose nourishment from its
birth had been mingled with bitterness, followed
in a few days. I saw myself seven children
crowd round the coffin that was provided by
charity; I saw three taken to the workhouse,
and the elder four distributed amongst kind-hearted
hard-working people, who are trying to
inure the young soft hands, accustomed to silken
idleness, to the toils of homely industry. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
ask you, John Adams, how the husband of that
woman, the father of those children, can meet
his God, when it is required of him to give an account of his stewardship?"</p>

<p>"It is very true&mdash;very shocking indeed," observed
Dr. Adams. "I certainly will do something
to secure my wife and children from the
possibility of any thing like <i>that</i>, although,
whatever were to happen to me, I am sure Lucy's family would prevent"&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles broke in upon the sentence his brother
found it difficult to complete&mdash;"And can
you expect distant or even near relatives to perform
what you, whose duty it is, neglect? Or
would you leave those dear ones to the bitterness
of dependence, when, by the sacrifice or curtailment
of those luxurious habits which, if not
closely watched, increase in number, and at
last become necessaries, you could leave them
in comfort and independence! We all hope
for the leisure of a death-bed&mdash;awful enough,
come as it may&mdash;awful, even when beyond its
gloom we see the risen Sun of Righteousness
in all his glory&mdash;awful, though our faith be
strong in Him who is our strength; but if the
consciousness of having neglected those duties
which we were sent on earth to perform be with
us then, dark, indeed, will be the Valley of the
Shadow of Death. I do not want, however, to
read a homily, my dear brother, but to impress
a truth; and I do hope that you will prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
the possibility of these dear children feeling
what they must feel, enduring what they must
endure, if <i>you</i> passed into another world without
performing your duty towards them, and through them to society, in this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams met her brother-in-law that day
(people five-and-twenty years ago did dine by
day) at dinner, with an air of offence. She was,
of course, lady-like and quiet, but it was evident
she was displeased. Every thing at table was
perfect according to its kind. There was no
guest present who was not superior in wealth
and position to the doctor himself, and each
was quite aware of the fact. Those who climb
boldly sometimes take a false step, but at all
times make dangerous ones. When Charles
looked round upon the splendid plate and stylish
servants&mdash;when the children were ushered
in after dinner, and every tongue was loud in
praises of their beauty&mdash;an involuntary shudder
passed through his heart, and he almost accused
himself of selfishness, when he was comforted
by the remembrance of the provision made
for his own little ones, who were as pretty, as
well educated, and as happy in their cheerful country home.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>




<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p>The next morning he was on his return to
Repton, happy in the assurance his brother had
given him before they parted, that he would
really lay by a large sum for the regular insurance of his life.</p>

<p>"My dear John," said the doctor's wife,
"when does the new carriage come home? I
thought we were to have had it this week. The
old chariot looked so dull to-day, just as you
were going out, when Dr. Fitzlane's new chocolate-colour
passed; certainly that chocolate-coloured
carriage picked out with blue and those
blue liveries are very, very pretty."</p>

<p>"Well, Lucy, I think them too gay&mdash;the liveries
I mean&mdash;for an M.D.; quieter colours do
best; and as to the new carriage, I had not absolutely
ordered it. I don't see why I cannot
go on with the jobs; and I almost think I shall
do so, and appropriate the money I intended
for <i>my own</i> carriage to another purpose."</p>

<p>"What purpose?"</p>

<p>"Why, to effect an insurance on my life.
There was a great deal of truth in what Charles
said the other day, although he said it coarsely,
which is not usual with him; but he felt the
subject, and I feel it also; so I think of, as I
said, going quietly on with the jobs&mdash;at all events
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
till next year&mdash;and devoting this money to the insurance."</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe how any woman,
situated as Mrs. Adams was, could have objected
to a plan so evidently for her advantage and
the advantage of her family; but she was one
of those who never like to think of the possibility
of a reverse of fortune&mdash;who thrust care off
as long as they can, and who feel more pleasure
in being lavish as to the present than in saving for the future.</p>

<p>"I am sure," she answered, in the half-petted
half-peevish tone that evinces a weak mind&mdash;"I
am sure if any thing was to happen to you,
I would break my heart at once, and my family,
of course, would provide for the children. I
could not bear the idea of reaping any advantage
by your death; and really the jobs are so
very inferior to what they used to be&mdash;and Dr.
Leeswor, next door but one, has purchased such
a handsome chariot&mdash;you have at least twice
his practice; and&mdash;Why, dear John, you
never were in such health; there will be no necessity
for this painful insurance. And after
you have set up your <i>own</i> carriage, you can begin
and lay by, and in a few years there will be
plenty for the children; and I shall not have
the galling feeling that any living thing would
profit by your death. Dear John, pray do not
think of this painful insurance; it may do very
well for a man like your brother&mdash;a man with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
out refinement; but just fancy the mental torture of such a provision."</p>

<p>Much more Mrs. Adams talked; and the
doctor, who loved display, and had no desire to
see Dr. Leeswor, his particular rival, or even
Dr. Fitzlane, better appointed than himself, felt
strongly inclined towards the new carriage, and
thought it would certainly be pleasanter to save
than to insure, and resolved to begin immediately
<i>after</i> the purchase of his new equipage.</p>

<p>When persons are very prosperous, a few ten
or twenty pounds do not much signify, but the
principle of careless expenditure is hard to curb.</p>

<p>Various things occurred to put off the doctor's
plan of laying by. Mrs. Adams had an illness,
that rendered a residence abroad necessary
for a winter or two. The eldest boy must
go to Eton. As their mamma was not at home,
the little girls were sent to school. Bad as Mrs.
Adams's management was, it was better than
no management at all. If the doctor had given
up his entertainments, his "friends" would have
said he was going down in the world, and his
patients would have imagined him less skilful;
besides, notwithstanding his increased expenditure,
he found he had ample means, not to lay
by, but to spend on without debt or difficulty.
Sometimes his promise to his brother would
cross his mind, but it was soon dispelled by
what he had led himself to believe was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
impossibility of attending to it then. When Mrs.
Adams returned, she complained that the children
were too much for her nerves and strength, and
her husband's tenderness induced him to yield
his favourite plan of bringing up his girls under
his own roof. In process of time two little ones
were added to the four, and still his means kept
pace with his expenses; in short, for ten years
he was a favourite with the class of persons who
render favouritism fortune. It is impossible,
within the compass of a tale, to trace the minuti
of the brothers' history; the children of both
were handsome, intelligent, and in the world's
opinion, well educated; John's eldest daughter
was one amongst a thousand for beauty of mind
and person; hers was no glaring display of
figure or information. She was gentle, tender,
and affectionate; of a disposition sensitive and
attuned to all those rare virtues in her sphere,
which form at once the treasures of domestic
life and the ornaments of society. She it was
who soothed the nervous irritability of her mother's
sick chamber and perpetual peevishness,
and graced her father's drawing-room by a presence
that was attractive to both old and young,
from its sweetness and unpretending modesty;
her two younger sisters called forth all her tenderness,
from the extreme delicacy of their health;
but her brothers were even greater objects of
solicitude&mdash;handsome spirited lads&mdash;the eldest
waiting for a situation, promised, but not given;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
the second also waiting for a cadetship; while
the youngest was still at Eton. These three
young men thought it incumbent on them to
evince their belief in their father's prosperity by
their expenditure, and accordingly they spent
much more than the sons of a professional man
ought to spend under any circumstances. Of
all waitings, the waiting upon patronage is the
most tedious and the most enervating to the
waiter. Dr. Adams felt it in all its bitterness
when his sons' bills came to be paid; but he
consoled himself, also, for his dilatoriness with
regard to a provision for his daughters&mdash;it was
impossible to lay by while his children were
being educated; but the moment his eldest
sons got the appointments they were promised,
he would certainly save, or insure, or do something.</p>

<p>People who only <i>talk</i> about doing "something,"
generally end by doing "nothing." Another
year passed; Mrs. Adams was still an
invalid, the younger girls more delicate than
ever, the boys waiting, as before, their promised
appointments, and more extravagant than ever;
and Miss Adams had made a conquest which
even her father thought worthy of her.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had become really attached
to this beautiful girl was of a high family,
who were sufficiently charmed with the object
of his affections to give their full sanction,
as far as person and position were concerned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
but the prudent father of the would-be bridegroom
thought it right to take an early opportunity
of waiting upon the doctor, stating his
son's prospects, and frankly asking what sum
Dr. Adams proposed settling on his daughter.
Great, indeed, was his astonishment at the reply&mdash;"He
should not be able to give his daughter
anything <i>immediately</i>, but at his death."
The doctor, for the first time for many years,
felt the bitterness of his <i>false position</i>. He hesitated,
degraded by the knowledge that he must
sink in the opinion of the man of the world by
whom he was addressed; he was irritated at
his want of available funds being known; and
though well aware that the affections of his darling
child were bound up in the son of the very
gentlemanly but most prudent person who sat
before him, he was so high and so irritable in
his bearing, that the fathers parted, not in anger,
but in any thing but good feeling.</p>

<p>Sir Augustus Barry was not slow to set before
his son the disadvantages of a union where
the extravagant habits of Miss Adams had no
more stable support than her father's life; he
argued that a want of forethought in the parents
would be likely to produce a want of forethought
in the children; and knowing well what
could be done with such means as Dr. Adams
had had at his command for years, he was not
inclined to put a kind construction upon so total
a want of the very quality which he considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
the best a man could possess; after some delay,
and much consideration of the matter, he told
his son that he really could not consent to his
marriage with a penniless bride. And Dr.
Adams, finding that the old gentleman, with a
total want of that delicacy which moneyed men
do not frequently possess, had spoken of what
he termed too truly and too strongly his "heartless"
want of forethought, and characterised as
a selfishness the indulgence of a love for display
and extravagance, when children were to
be placed in the world and portioned&mdash;insulted
the son for the fault of the father, and forbade his daughter to receive him.</p>

<p>Mary Adams endeavoured to bear this as
meekly as she had borne the flattery and the
tenderness which had been lavished on her since
her birth. The bitter, bitter knowledge that
she was considered by her lover's family as a
girl who, with the chance of being penniless,
lived like a princess, was inconceivably galling;
and though she had dismissed her lover, and
knew that her father had insulted him, still she
wondered how he could so soon forget her, and
never write even a line of farewell. From her
mother she did not expect sympathy; she was
too tender and too proud to seek it; and her
father, more occupied than ever, was seldom in
his own house. Her uncle, who had not been in
town for some years, at last arrived, and was not
less struck by the extreme grace and beauty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
his niece, than by the deep melancholy which saddened
her voice and weighed down her spirits.
He was evidently anxious to mention something
which made him joyous and happy; and when
the doctor entered the library with him, he said,
"And may not Mary come in also?" Mary
did come in; and her gentle presence subdued
her uncle's spirits. "I had meant to tell the
intended change in my family only to you, brother
John; but it has occurred to me we were
all wrong about my niece; they said at home,
'Do not invite my cousin, she is too fine, too
gay to come to a country wedding; she would
not like it;' but I think, surrounded as she is
by luxuries, that the fresh air of Repton, the
fresh flowers, fresh fields, and fresh smiles of
her cousins would do my niece good, great good,
and we shall be quite gay in our own homely way&mdash;the
gaiety that upsprings from hearts grateful
to the Almighty for his goodness. The fact
is, that in about three weeks <i>my</i> Mary is to be
married to our rector's eldest son! In three
weeks. As he is only his father's curate, they
could not have afforded to marry for five or six
years, if I had not been able to tell down a handsome
sum for Mary's fortune; it was a proud
thing to be able to make a good child happy
by care in time. 'Care in time,' that's my
stronghold! How glad we were to look back
and think, that while we educated them properly,
we denied ourselves to perform our duty to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
the children God had given to our care. We
have not been as <i>gay</i> as our neighbours, whose
means were less than ours; we could not be
so, seeing we had to provide for five children;
but our pleasure has been to elevate and render
those children happy and prosperous. Mary
will be so happy, dear child&mdash;so happy! Only
think, John, she will be six years the sooner
happy from our <i>care in time</i>!" This was more
than his niece could bear. The good father
was so full of his daughter's happiness, and the
doctor so overwhelmed with self-reproach&mdash;never
felt so bitterly as at that moment&mdash;that
neither perceived the death-like paleness that
overspread the less fortunate Mary's face. She
got up to leave the room, staggered, and fell at her father's feet.</p>

<p>"We have murdered her between us," muttered
Dr. Adams, while he raised her up; "murdered
her; but <i>I</i> struck the first blow. God forgive me! God forgive me!"</p>

<p>That night the brothers spent in deep and
earnest converse. The certainty of his own
prosperity, the self-gratulation that follows a
just and careful discharge of duties imposed
alike by reason and religion, had not raised
Charles above his brother in his own esteem.
Pained beyond description at the suffering he
had so unconsciously inflicted on his niece&mdash;horror-struck
at the fact, that thousands upon
thousands had been lavished, yet nothing done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
for hereafter, the hereafter that <i>must</i> come, he
urged upon John the danger of delay, the uncertainty
of life. Circumstances increased his
influence. Dr. Adams had been made painfully
aware that gilding was not gold. The beauty,
position, and talents of his beloved child, although
fully acknowledged, had failed to establish
her in life. "Look, Charles," he said, after
imparting all to his brother, absolutely weeping
over the state of uncomplaining but deep sorrow
to which his child was reduced, "if I could
command the necessary sum, I would to-morrow
insure my life for a sum that would place
them beyond the possible reach of necessity of any kind."</p>

<p>"Do not wait for that," was the generous
reply of Charles Adams; "I have some unemployed hundreds at this moment. Come with
me to-morrow; do not delay a day, no, nor an
hour; and take my word for it you will have
reason to bless your resolve. Only imagine
what would be the case if God called you to
give an account of your stewardship." But he
checked himself; he saw that more was not
necessary; and the brothers separated for a few
hours, both anxious for the morning. It was
impossible to say which of the two hurried over
breakfast with the greatest rapidity. The carriage
was at the door; and Dr. Adams left word
with his butler that he was gone into the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
on urgent business, and would be back in two hours.</p>

<p>"I don't think," exclaimed Charles, rubbing
his hands gleefully, "I don't think, that if my
dear niece were happy, I should ever have been
so happy in all my life as I am at this moment."</p>

<p>"I feel already," replied John, "as if a great
weight were removed from my heart; and were
it not for the debt which I have contracted to
you&mdash;Ah, Charles, I little dreamt, when I
looked down from the hill over Repton, and
thought my store inexhaustible, that I should be
obliged to you thus late in life. And yet I protest
I hardly know where I could have drawn
in; one expense grows so out of another. These
boys have been so very extravagant; but I shall
soon have the two eldest off; they cannot keep them much longer waiting."</p>

<p>"Work is better than waiting; but let the
lads fight their way; they have had, I suppose,
a good education; they ought to have had professions.
There is something to me awfully
lazy in your 'appointments;' a young man of
spirit will appoint himself; but it is the females
of a family, brought up, as yours have been,
who are to be considered. Women's position
in society is changed from what it was some
years ago; it was expected that they must
marry; and so they were left, before their marriage,
dependent upon fathers and brothers, as
creatures that could do nothing for themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
Now, poor things, I really don't know why,
but girls do not marry off as they used. They
become old, and frequently&mdash;owing to the expectation
of their settling&mdash;without the provision
necessary for a comfortable old age. This is
the parent of those despicable tricks and arts
which women resort to to get married, as they
have no acknowledged position independent of
matrimony. Something ought to be done to
prevent this. And when the country steadies a
little from the great revolution of past years, I
suppose something may be thought of by improved
teaching&mdash;and systems to enable women
to assist themselves, and be recompensed for
the assistance they yield others. Now, imagine
your dear girls, those younger ones particularly, deprived of you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here is the patient upon whom I must call,
<i>en route</i>" interrupted the doctor.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Charles, "you had called here
on your return. I wanted the insurance to
have been your first business to-day."</p>

<p>"I shall not be five minutes," was the reply.
The servant let down the step, and the doctor
bounded up towards the open door. In his progress,
he trod upon a bit, a mere shred, of orange-peel;
it was the mischief of a moment; he slipped,
and his temple struck against the sharp
column of an iron-scraper. Within one hour,
Dr. John Adams had ceased to exist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>
What the mental and bodily agony of that
one hour was, you can better understand than
I can describe. He was fully conscious that he
was dying&mdash;and he knew all the misery that was to follow.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<p>"Mary my dear niece," said Charles Adams,
as he seated himself by her side; "my dear,
dear niece, can you fix your thoughts, and give
me your attention for half an hour, now that all
is over, and the demands of the world press upon
us. I want to speak about the future. Your
mother bursts into such fits of despair that I can
do nothing with her; and your brother is so
ungovernable&mdash;talks as if he could command
the bank of England, and is so full of his mother's
connexions and their influence, that I
have left him to himself. Can you, my dear
Mary, restrain your feelings, and give me your attention?"</p>

<p>Mary Adams looked firmly in her uncle's
face, and said, "I will try. I have been thinking
and planning all the morning, but I do not
know how to begin being useful. If I once began,
I could go on. The sooner we are out of
this huge expensive house the better; if I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
get my mother to go with the little girls to the
sea-side. Take her away altogether from this home&mdash;take her"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where?" inquired Mr. Adams; "she will not accept shelter in my house."</p>

<p>"I do not know," answered his niece, relapsing
into all the helplessness of first grief; "indeed
I do not know; her brother-in-law, Sir
James Ashbroke, invited her to the Pleasaunce,
but my brother objects to her going there, his
uncle has behaved so neglectfully about his appointment."</p>

<p>"Foolish boy!" muttered Charles; "this is
no time to quarrel about trifles. The fact is,
Mary, that the sooner you are all out of this
house the better; there are one or two creditors,
not for large sums certainly, but still men
who will have their money; and if we do not
quietly sell off, they will force us. The house
might have been disposed of last week by private
contract, but your mother would not hear
of it, because the person who offered was a medical rival of my poor brother."</p>

<p>Mary did not hear the concluding observation;
her eyes wandered from object to object
in the room&mdash;the harp&mdash;the various things
known from childhood. "Any thing you and
your mother wish, my dear niece," said her kind
uncle, "shall be preserved&mdash;the family pictures&mdash;your
harp&mdash;your piano&mdash;they are all hallowed
memorials, and shall be kept sacred."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>

<p>Mary burst into tears. "I do not," she said,
"shrink from considering those instruments the
means of my support; but although I know the
necessity for so considering, I feel I cannot tell
what at quitting the home of my childhood;
people are all kind; you, my dear uncle, from
whom we expected so little, the kindest of all;
but I see, even in these early days of a first sorrow,
indications of falling off. My aunt's husband
has really behaved very badly about the
appointment of my eldest brother; and as to
the cadetship for the second&mdash;we had such a
brief dry letter from our Indian friend&mdash;so many
first on the list, and the necessity for waiting,
that I do not know how it will end."</p>

<p>"I wish, my dear, you could prevail on your
mother, and sister, and all, to come to Repton,"
said Mr. Adams. "If your mother dislikes
being in my house, I would find her a cottage
near us; I will do all I can. My wife joins
me in the determination to think that we have
six additional children to look to. We differ
from you in our habits; but our hearts and affections
are no less true to you all. My Mary and you will be as sisters."</p>

<p>His niece could bear no more kindness. She
had been far more bitterly disappointed than she
had confessed even to her uncle; and yet the very
bitterness of the disappointment had been the
first thing that had driven her father's dying wail
from her ears&mdash;that cry repeated so often and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
so bitterly in the brief moments left after his accident&mdash;"My
children! My children!" He
had not sufficient faith to commit them to God's
mercy; he knew he had not been a faithful
steward; and he could not bring himself from
the depths of his spiritual blindness to call upon
the Fountain that is never dried up to those who
would humbly and earnestly partake of its living waters.</p>

<p>It was all a scene as of another world to the
young, beautiful, petted, and feted girl; it had
made her forget the disappointment of her love,
at least for a time. While her brothers dared the
thunder-cloud that burst above their heads, her
mother and sisters wept beneath its influence.
Mary had looked forth, and if she did not hope,
she thought, and tried to pray; now, she fell
weeping upon her uncle's shoulder; when she
could speak, she said, "Forgive me; in a little
time I shall be able to conquer this; at present,
I am overwhelmed; I feel as if knowledge and
sorrow came together; I seem to have read
more of human nature within the last three days than in all my past life."</p>

<p>"It all depends, Mary, upon the person you
meet," said Mr. Adams, "as upon the book you
read; if you choose a foolish book or a bad
book, you can expect nothing but vice or foolishness;
if you choose a foolish companion,
surely you cannot expect kindness or strength."
The kind-hearted man repeated to her all he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
had before said. "I cannot," he added, "be
guilty of injustice to my children; but I can
merge all my own luxuries into the one of being a father to the fatherless."</p>

<p>But to all the plans of Charles Adams, objections
were raised by his eldest nephew and his
mother; the youth could not brook the control
of a simple straight-minded country man, whose
only claim to be considered a gentleman, in his
opinion, arose from his connexion with "his
family." He was also indignant with his maternal
uncle for his broken promise, and these
feelings were strengthened by his mother's folly.
Two opportunities for disposing of the house
and its magnificent furniture were missed; and
when Mrs. Adams complained to her nearest
and most influential connexions that her brother-in-law
refused to make her any allowance unless
she consented to live at Repton&mdash;expecting
that they would be loud in their indignation at his
hardness&mdash;they advised her by all means to do
what he wished, as he was really the only person
she had to depend upon. Others were lavish
of their sympathy, but sympathy wears out
quickly; others invited her to spend a month
with them at their country-seat, for change of
air; one hinted how valuable Miss Adams' exquisite
musical talent would be <i>now</i>. Mary
coloured, and said, "Yes," with the dignity of
proper feeling; but her mother asked the lady
what she meant, and a little scene followed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
which caused the lady to visit all the families in
town of her acquaintance, for the purpose of
expressing her sympathy with "those poor dear
Adamses, who were so proud, poor things, that
really there was nothing hut starvation and the
workhouse before them!" Another of those
well-meaning persons&mdash;strong-minded and kind-hearted,
but without a particle of delicacy&mdash;came
to poor Mary, with all <i>prestige</i> of conferring a favour.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, it is the commonest
thing in the world&mdash;very painful but very common;
the families of professional men are frequently
left without provision. Such a pity!&mdash;because,
if they cannot save, they can insure.
We <i>all</i> can do <i>that</i>, but they do <i>not</i> do it, and
consequently everywhere the families of professional
men are found in distress; so, as I said,
it is common; and I wanted you to suggest to
your mother, that, if she would not feel hurt at
it, the thing being so common&mdash;dear Dr. Adams
having been so popular, so very popular&mdash;that
while every one is talking about him and you
all, a very handsome subscription could be got
up. I would begin it with a sum large enough
to invite still larger. I had a great regard for him&mdash;I had indeed."</p>

<p>Mary felt her heart sink and rise, and her
throat swell, so that she could not speak. She
had brought herself to the determination of employing
her talents for her own support, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
was not prepared to come with her family before
the world as paupers. "We have no claim
upon the public," she said at last. "I am sure
you mean us kindly, but we have no claim.
My dear father forwarded no public work&mdash;no
public object; he gave his advice, and received
his payment. If we are not provided for, it is
no public fault. Besides, my father's children
are able and willing to support themselves. I
am sure you mean us kindly, but we have no
claim upon public sympathy, and an appeal to
it would crush us to the earth. I am very glad
you did not speak first to my mother. My
uncle Charles would not suffer it, even suppose she wished it."</p>

<p>This friend also departed to excite new speculations
as to the pride and poverty of "poor
dear Dr. Adams's family." In the world, however&mdash;the
busy busy London world&mdash;it is idle to
expect any thing to create even a nine days'
wonder. When the house and furniture were
at last offered for sale, the feeling was somewhat
revived; and Mary, whose beauty, exquisite
as it was, had so unobtrusive a character as
never to have created a foe, was remembered
with tears by many: even the father of her old
lover, when he was congratulated by one more
worldly-minded than himself on the escape of
his son in not marrying a portionless girl, reproved
the unfeeling speaker with a wish that
he only hoped his son might have as good a
wife as Mary Adams would have been.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>




<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<p>The bills were taken down, the house purified
from the auction-mob&mdash;every thing changed;
a new name occupied the doctor's place in
the "Court Guide"&mdash;and in three months the
family seemed as completely forgotten amongst
those of whom they once formed a prominent
part, as if they had never existed. When one
sphere of life closes against a family, they find
room in another. Many kind-hearted persons
in Mrs. Adams's first circle would have been
rejoiced to be of service to her and hers, but
they were exactly the people upon whom she
had no claim. Of a high but poor family, her
relatives had little power. What family so situated
ever had any influence beyond what they
absolutely needed for themselves? With an
ill grace she at last acceded to the kind offer
made by Mr. Charles Adams, and took possession
of the cottage he fixed upon, until something
could be done for his brother's children. In a
fit of proud despair the eldest son enlisted into
a regiment of dragoons; the second was fortunate
enough to obtain a cadetship through a
stranger's interference; and his uncle thought
it might be possible to get the youngest forward
in his father's profession. The expense of the
necessary arrangements was severely felt by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
prudent and careful country gentleman. The
younger girls were too delicate for even the
common occupations of daily life; and Mary,
instead of receiving the welcome she had been
led to expect from her aunt and cousins, felt
that every hour she spent at the Grange was an intrusion.</p>

<p>The sudden death of Dr. Adams had postponed
the intended wedding of Charles Adams's
eldest daughter; and although her mother
agreed that it was their duty to forward the
orphan children, she certainly felt, as most affectionate
mothers whose hearts are not very
much enlarged would feel, that much of their
own savings&mdash;much of the produce of her husband's
hard labour&mdash;labour during a series of
years when her sister-in-law and her children
were enjoying all the luxuries of life&mdash;would
now be expended for their support; this to an
all-sacrificing mother, despite <i>her sense of the
duty of kindness</i>, was hard to bear. As long as
they were not on the spot, she theorised continually,
and derived much satisfaction from the
sympathising observations of her neighbours,
and was proud, <i>very</i> proud, of the praise bestowed
upon her husband's benevolence; but
when her sister-in-law's expensive habits were in
daily array before her (the cottage being close
to the Grange,) when she knew, to use her own
expression, "that she never put her hand to a
single thing;" that she could not live without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>
port wine, when she herself never drank even
gooseberry, except on Sundays; never ironed
a collar, never dusted the chimney-piece, or ate
a shoulder of mutton&mdash;roast one day, cold the
next, and hashed the third. While each day
brought some fresh illustration of her thoughtlessness
to the eyes of the wife of the wealthy
tiller of the soil, the widow of the physician
thought herself in the daily practice of the most
rigid self-denial. "I am sure," was her constant
observation to her all-patient daughter&mdash;"I
am sure I never thought it would come to
this. I had not an idea of going through so
much. I wonder your uncle and his wife can
permit me to live in the way I do&mdash;they ought
to consider how I was brought up." It was in
vain Mary represented that they were existing
upon charity; that they ought to be most grateful
for what they received, coming as it did from
those who, in their days of prosperity, professed
nothing, while those who professed all things
had done nothing. Mary would so reason, and
then retire to her own chamber to weep alone over things more hard to bear.</p>

<p>It is painful to observe what bitterness will
creep into the heart and manner of really kind
girls where a lover is in the case, or even where
a common-place dangling sort of flirtation is
going forward; this depreciating ill nature, one
of the other, is not confined by any means to
the fair sex. Young men pick each other to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>
pieces with even more fierceness, but less ingenuity;
they deal in a cut-and-hack sort of sarcasm,
and do not hesitate to use terms and insinuations
of the harshest kind, when a lady is in
the case. Mary (to distinguish her from her
high-bred cousin, she was generally called Mary
Charles) was certainly disappointed when her
wedding was postponed in consequence of her
uncle's death; but a much more painful feeling
followed, when she saw the admiration her lover,
Edwin Lechmere, bestowed upon her beautiful
cousin. Mary Charles was herself a beauty&mdash;fair,
open-eyed, warm-hearted&mdash;<i>the</i> beauty of
Repton; but though feature by feature, inch by
inch, she was as handsome as Mary, yet in her
cousin was the grace and spirit given only by
good society; the manners elevated by a higher
mind, and toned down by sorrow; a gentle
softness, which a keen observer of human nature
told me once no woman ever possessed
unless she had deeply loved, and suffered from
disappointed affection; in short, she was far
more refined, far more fascinating, than her
country cousin: besides, she was unfortunate,
and that at once gave her a hold upon the sympathies
of the young curate: it did no more:
but Mary Charles did not understand these nice
distinctions, and nothing could exceed the
change of manner she evinced when her cousin and her betrothed were together.</p>

<p>Mary thought her cousin rude and petulant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
but the true cause of the change never occurred
to her. Accustomed to the high-toned courtesy
of well-bred men, which is so little practised in
the middle class of English society, it never suggested
itself, that placing her chair, or opening
the door for her to go out, or rising courteously
when she came into a room, was more than, as
a lady, she had a right to expect; in truth, she
did not notice it at all; but she did notice and
feel deeply her cousin's alternate coldness and
snappishness of manner. "I would not,"
thought Mary, "have behaved so to her if she
had been left desolate; but in a little time, when
my mother is more content, I will leave Repton,
and become independent by my talents." Never
did she think of the power delegated to her by,
the Almighty without feeling herself raised&mdash;ay,
higher than she had ever been in the days of her
splendour&mdash;in the scale of moral usefulness; as
every one must feel whose mind is rightly
framed. She had not yet known what it was to
have her abilities trampled on or insulted; she
had never experienced the bitterness consequent
upon having the acquirements&mdash;which in the
days of her prosperity commanded silence and
admiration&mdash;sneered at or openly ridiculed.&mdash;She
had yet to learn that the Solons, the law-givers
of English society, lavish their attentions
and praise upon those who learn, not upon those who teach.</p>

<p>Mary had not been six months fatherless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
when she was astonished, first by a letter, and
then by a visit, from her former lover; he came
to renew his engagement, and to wed her even
then if she would have him; but Mary's high
principle was stronger than he imagined. "No,"
she said, "you are not independent of your
father, and whatever I feel, I have no right to
draw <i>you</i> down into poverty. You may fancy
now that you could bear it; but a time would
come&mdash;if not to you, to me&mdash;when the utter
selfishness of such conduct would goad me to
a death of early misery." The young man appealed
to her uncle, who thought her feelings
overstrained, but respected her for it nevertheless;
and in the warmth of his admiration, he
communicated the circumstance to his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>"Refuse her old lover under present circumstances,"
repeated her cousin to herself as she
left the room; "there must be some other reason
than that; she could not be so foolish as to
reject such an offer at such a time." Unfortunately,
she saw Edwin Lechmere walking by
Mary's side, under the shadow of some trees.
She watched them until the foliage screened
them from her sight, and then she shut herself
into her own room, and yielded to a long and
violent burst of tears. "It is not enough," she
exclaimed, in the bitterness of her feelings, "that
the comforts of my parents' declining years
should be abridged by the overwhelming burden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>
to their exertions&mdash;another family added to their
own; it is not enough that an uncomfortable
feeling has grown between my father and mother
on this account, and that cold looks and
sharp words have come where they never came
before, but my peace of mind must be destroyed.
Gladly would I have taken a smaller portion,
if I could have kept the affections which I
see but too plainly my cousin has stolen from
me. And my thoughtless aunt to say, only yesterday,
that 'at all events her husband was no
man's enemy but his own.' Has not his want
of prudent forethought been the ruin of his own
children? and will my parents ever recover the
anxiety, the pain, the sacrifices, brought on by
one man's culpable neglect? Oh, uncle! if
you could look from your grave upon the misery
you have caused!"&mdash;and then, exhausted by
her own emotion, the affectionate but jealous
girl began to question herself as to what she
should do. After what she considered mature
deliberation, she made up her mind to upbraid
her cousin with treachery, and she put her design into execution that same evening.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to oblige her cousin to
understand what she meant; but at last the declaration
that she had refused her old lover because
she had placed her affections upon Edwin
Lechmere, whom she was endeavouring to
"entrap," was not to be mistaken; and the
country girl was altogether unprepared for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
burst of indignant feeling, mingled with much
bitterness, which repelled the untruth. A strong
fit of hysterics, into which Mary Charles worked
herself, was terminated by a scene of the
most painful kind, her father being upbraided
by her mother with "loving other people's children
better than his own," while the curate himself
knelt by the side of his betrothed, assuring
her of his unaltered affection. From such a
scene Miss Adams hastened with a throbbing
brow and a bursting heart. She had no one to
counsel or console her; no one to whom she
could apply for aid. For the first time since she
had experienced her uncle's tenderness, she felt
she had been the means of disturbing his domestic
peace; the knowledge of the burden she
and hers were considered, weighed her to the
earth; and in a paroxysm of anguish she fell
on her knees, exclaiming, "Oh, why are the
dependent born into the world! Father, father,
why did you leave us, whom you so loved, to
such a fate!" And then she reproached herself
for having uttered a word reflecting on his
memory. One of the every-day occurrences of
life&mdash;so common as to be hardly observed&mdash;is
to find really kind, good-natured people not
"weary of well-doing." "Oh, really I was
worn out with so-and-so; they are so decidedly
unfortunate that it is impossible to help them,"
is a general excuse for deserting those whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
continuing misfortunes ought to render them greater objects of sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Adams was, as has been shown
in our little narrative, a kind-hearted man. Estranged
as his brother and himself had been for
a number of years, he had done much to forward,
and still more to protect, his children.
At first, this was a pleasure; but somehow his
"benevolence," and "kindness," and "generosity,"
had been so talked about, so eulogised,
and he had been so seriously inconvenienced
by the waywardness of his nephews, the thoughtless
pride of his sister-in-law, the helplessness
of his younger nieces, as to feel seriously oppressed
by his responsibility. And now the one
who had never given him aught but pleasure,
seemed, according to his daughter's representations,
to be the cause of increased sorrow, the
destroyer of his dear child's happiness. What
to do he could not tell. His daughter, wrought
upon by her own jealousy, had evinced, under
its influence, so much temper she had never displayed
before, that it seemed more than likely
the cherished match would be broken off. His
high-minded niece saved him any farther anxiety
as far as she was concerned. She sent for
and convinced him fully and entirely of her total
freedom from the base design imputed to
her. "Was it likely," she said, "that I should
reject the man I love lest I should drag him into
poverty, and plunge at once with one I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
care for into the abyss I dread? This is the
common sense view of the case; but there is
yet another. Is it to be borne that I would
seek to rob <i>your</i> child of her happiness? The
supposition is an insult too gross to be endured.
I will leave my mother to-morrow. An old
school-fellow, older and more fortunate than
myself, wished me to educate her little girl. I
had one or two strong objections to living in her
house; but the desire to be independent and
away has overcome them." She then, with
many tears, entreated her uncle still to protect
her mother; urged how she had been sorely
tried; and communicated fears, she had reason
to believe were too well founded, that her eldest
brother, feeling the reverse more than he
could bear, had deserted from his regiment.</p>

<p>Charles Adams was deeply moved by the nobleness
of his niece, and reproved his daughter
more harshly than he had ever done before, for
the feebleness that created so strong and unjust
a passion. This had the contrary effect to what
he had hoped for: she did not hesitate to say
that her cousin had endeavoured to rob her both
of the affection of her lover and her father.
The injured cousin left Repton bowed beneath
an accumulation of troubles, not one of which
was of her own creating, not one of which she
deserved; and all springing from the unproviding
nature of him who, had he been asked the
question, would have declared himself ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>
sacrifice his own life for the advantage of that
daughter, now compelled to work for her own
bread. To trace the career of Mary Adams in
her new calling, would be to repeat what I have
said before. The more refined, the more informed
the governess, the more she suffers.
Being with one whom she had known in better
days, made it even more hard to bend; yet she
did her duty, and <i>that</i> is one of the highest privileges a woman can enjoy.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>


<p>Leaving Mary for a moment, let us return to
Repton. Here discord, having once entered,
was making sad ravages, and all were suffering
from it. It was but too true that the eldest of
the Adamses had deserted; his mother clinging
with a parent's fondness to her child, concealed
him, and thus offended Charles Adams beyond
all reconciliation. The third lad, who was
walking the London hospitals, and exerting
himself beyond his strength, was everything
that a youth could be; but his declining health
was represented to his uncle, by one of those
whom his mother's pride had insulted, as a cloak
for indolence. In short, before another year
had quite passed, the family of the once rich and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>
fashionable Dr. Adams had shared the fate of
all dependents&mdash;worn out the benevolence, or
patience, or whatever it really is, of their "best
friends." Nor was this the only consequence
of the physician's neglect of a duty due alike
to God and society; his brother had really done
so much for the bereaved family, as to give
what the world called "just grounds" to Mrs.
Charles Adams's repeated complaints, "that
now her husband was ruining his industrious
family to keep the lazy widow of his spend-thrift
brother and her favourite children in idleness.
Why could she not live upon the 'fine
folk' she was always throwing in her face?"
The daughter, too, of whose approaching union
the fond father had been so proud, was now,
like her cousin whom she had wronged by her
mean suspicions, deserted; the match broken
off after much bickering; one quarrel having
brought on another, until they separated by
mutual consent. Her temper and her health
were both materially impaired; and her beauty
was converted into hardness and acidity.</p>

<p>Oh! how utterly groundless is the idea, that
in our social state, where one human being
must so much depend upon another, any man,
neglecting his positive duties, can be called
only "his own enemy." What misery had not
Dr. Adams's neglect entailed, not alone on his
immediate family, but on that of his brother.
Besides, there were ramifications of distress;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>
he died even more embarrassed than his brother
had at first believed, and some trades-people
were consequently embarrassed; but the deep
misery fell upon his children. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Dr. Adams had left Repton with her
younger children, to be the dependants of Mary in London.</p>

<p>It was not until a fatal disease had seized upon
her mother, that Mary ventured to appeal
again to her uncle's generosity. "My second
brother," she said, "has out of his small means
remitted her five pounds. My eldest brother
seems altogether to have disappeared from
amongst us; finding that his unhappy presence
had occasioned so fatal a separation between
his mother and you&mdash;a disunion which I saw
was the effect of many small causes, rather
than one great one&mdash;he left us, and we cannot
trace him. This has broken my poor mother's
heart; he was the cherished one of all her children.
My youngest brother has been for the
last month an inmate of one of the hospitals
which my poor father attended for so many
years, and where his word was law. My sister
Rosa, she upon whom my poor father poured,
if possible, more of his affection than he bestowed
upon me&mdash;my lovely sister, of whom,
even in our poverty, I was so proud&mdash;so young,
only upon the verge of womanhood&mdash;has, you
already know, left us. Would to God it had
been for her grave, rather than her destroyer!&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
fellow-student of that poor youth, who, if
he dreamt of her dishonour, would stagger like
a spectre from what will be his death-bed to
avenge her. Poverty is one of the surest guides
to dishonour; those who have not been tempted
know nothing of it. It is one thing to see
it, another to feel it. Do not think her altogether
base, because she had not the strength of
a heroine. I have been obliged to resign my
situation to attend my mother, and the only income
we have is what I earn by giving lessons
on the harp and piano. I give, for <i>two shillings</i>,
the same instruction for which my father paid
half a guinea a lesson; if I did not I should
have no pupils. It is more than a month since
my mother left her bed; and my youngest sister,
bending beneath increased delicacy of
health, is her only attendant. I know her
mind to be so tortured, and her body so convulsed
by pain, that I have prayed to God to
render her fit for Heaven, and take her from
her sufferings. Imagine the weight of sorrow
that crushed me to my knees with such a petition
as that. I know all you have done, and
yet I ask you now, in remembrance of the boyish
love that bound you and my father together,
to lessen her bodily anguish by the sacrifice of
a little more; that she, nursed in the lap of
luxury, may not pass from life with starvation
as her companion. My brother's gift is expended; and during the last three weeks I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
have earned but twelve shillings; my pupils
are out of town. Do, for a moment remember
what I was, and think how humbled I must be
to frame this supplication; but it is a child that
petitions for a parent, and I know I have never
forfeited your esteem. In a few weeks, perhaps
in a few days, my brother and my mother will
meet my poor father face to face. Oh! that I
could be assured that reproach and bitterness
for the past do not pass the portals of the grave.
Forgive me this, as you have already forgiven
me much. Alas! I know too well that our misfortunes
drew misfortunes upon others. I was
the unhappy but innocent cause of much sorrow
at the Grange; but, oh! do not refuse the
<i>last</i> request that I will ever make." The letter was blotted by tears.</p>

<p>Charles Adams was from home when it arrived,
and his wife, knowing the handwriting,
and having made a resolution never to open a
letter "from that branch of the family," did
not send it after her husband "lest it might
tease him." Ten days elapsed before he received
it; and when he did, he could not be
content with writing, but lost not a moment in
hastening to the address. Irritated and disappointed
that what he really had done should
have been so little appreciated, when every hour
of his life he was smarting in one way or other
from his exertions&mdash;broken-hearted at his daughter's
blighted health and happiness&mdash;angered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span>
by the reckless wildness of one nephew, and
what he believed was the idleness of another&mdash;and
convinced that Rosa's fearful step was owing
to the pampering and mismanagement of
her foolish mother&mdash;Charles Adams satisfied
himself that, as he did not hear to the contrary
from Mary, all things were going on well, or at
least not ill. He thought as little about them
as he possibly could, no people in the world being
so conveniently forgotten (when they are not
importunate) as poor relations; but the letter of
his favourite niece spoke strongly to his heart,
and in two hours after his return home he set
forth for the London suburb from whence the
letter was dated. It so chanced, that to get to
that particular end of the town, he was obliged
to pass the house his brother had occupied so
splendidly for a number of years; the servants
had lit the lamps, and were drawing the curtains
of the noble dining-room; and a party of ladies
were descending from a carriage, which prevented
two others from setting down. It looked
like old times. "Some one else," thought
Charles Adams, "running the same career of
wealth and extravagance. God grant it may
not lead to the same results!" He paused, and
looked up the front of the noble mansion; the
drawing-room windows were open, and two
beautiful children were standing on an ottoman
placed between the windows, probably to keep
them apart. He thought of Mary's childhood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>
and how she was occupied at that moment, and
hastened onward. There are times when life
seems one mingled dream, and it is not easy to
become dispossessed of the idea when some of
its frightful changes are brought almost together under our view.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Adams at home?" inquired her
uncle of a woman leaning against the door of a miserable house.</p>

<p>"I don't know; she went to the hospital this
morning; but I'm not sure she's in; it's the
second pair back; it's easy known, for the sob
has not ceased in that room these two nights; some people do take on so"&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles Adams did not hear the concluding
sentence, but sought the room; the door would
not close, and he heard a low sobbing sound
from within; he paused, but his step had aroused
the mourner&mdash;"Come in, Mary; come in; I
know how it is," said a young voice; "he is
dead; one grave for mother and son&mdash;one
grave for mother and son! I see your shadow,
dark as it is; have you brought a candle? It
is very fearful to be alone with the dead&mdash;even one's own mother&mdash;in the dark."</p>

<p>Charles Adams entered the room; but his
sudden appearance in the twilight, and evidently
not knowing him, overcame the girl, his
youngest niece, so much, that she screamed,
and fell on her knees by her mother's corpse.
He called for lights, and was speedily obeyed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>
for he put a piece of gold in the woman's hand.
She turned it over, and as she hastened from
the room, muttered, "If this had come sooner,
she'd not have died of starvation or burdened
the parish for a shroud; it's hard the rich can't look to their own."</p>

<p>When Mary returned, she was fearfully calm.
"No, her brother was not dead," she said; "the
young were longer dying than those whom the
world had worn out; the young knew so little
of the world, they thought it hard to leave it;"
and she took off her bonnet, and sat down;
and while her uncle explained why he had not
written, she looked at him with eyes so fixed
and cold, that he paused, hoping she would speak,
so painful was their stony expression; but she
let him go on, without offering one word of assurance
of any kind feeling or remembrance;
and when she stooped to adjust a portion of the
coarse plaiting of the shroud&mdash;that mockery of
"the purple and fine linen of living days"&mdash;her
uncle saw that her hair, her luxuriant hair, was striped with white.</p>

<p>"There is no need for words now," she said
at last; "no need. I thought you would have
sent; she required but little&mdash;but very little; the
dust rubbed from the gold she once had would
have been riches: but the little she did require
she had not, and so she died; but what weighs
heaviest upon my mind was her calling so continually
on my father, to know <i>why</i> he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
deserted her: she attached no blame latterly to
any one, only called day and night upon him.
Oh! it was hard to bear&mdash;it was very hard to bear."</p>

<p>"I will send a proper person in the morning
to arrange that she may be placed with my brother," said Charles.</p>

<p>Mary shrieked almost with the wildness of a
maniac. "No, no; as far from him as possible! Oh! not with him! She was to blame
in our days of splendour as much as he was;
but she could not see it; and I durst not reason
with her. Not with him! <i>She would disturb him in his grave!</i>"</p>

<p>Her uncle shuddered, while the young girl
sobbed in the bitter wailing tone their landlady complained of.</p>

<p>"No," resumed Mary, "let the parish bury
her; even its officers were kind; and if you
bury her, or they, it is still a pauper's funeral.
I see all these things clearly now; death, while
it closes the eyes of some, opens the eyes of others; it has opened mine."</p>

<p>But why should I prolong this sad story. It
is not the tale of one, but of many. There are
dozens, scores, hundreds of instances of the
same kind, <i>arising from the same cause</i>, in our
broad islands. In the lunatic asylum, where
that poor girl, even Mary Adams, has found refuge
during the past two years, there are many
cases of insanity arising from change of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
circumstances, where a fifty pounds' insurance
would have set such maddening distress at defiance.
I know that her brother died in the hospital
within a few days; and the pale, sunken-eyed
girl, whose damp yellow hair and thin
white hand are so eagerly kissed by the gentle
maniac when she visits her, month by month, is
the youngest, and, I believe, the <i>last</i> of her family,
at least the last in England. Oh, that those
who foolishly boast that their actions only affect
themselves, would look carefully abroad, and if
they doubt what I have faithfully told, examine

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
